<p>Chief Hennen was  selected on numerous occasions as Soldier and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) of  the Quarter/Year by the various commands and agencies to which he was assigned  during his enlisted career.</p>

<p>Chief Hennen was the  first and remains the only Warrant Officer within the U.S. Army and the  Department of Defense to have been selected as a member of a Space Shuttle  flight crew.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Chief  Hennen served over 23 years in the imagery intelligence field. He received extensive technical training and  experience as an operational imagery analyst at both the national and tactical  levels; experience as an instructor; training, force, and combat developer;  extensive material development and acquisition management experience - all of  which combined to make him one of the most qualified imagery intelligence  technicians within the Department of Defense (DOD).</p>

<p>From 1973 to 1975, he  was assigned to the 163rd Military Intelligence Battalion, Fort Hood, Texas. During the assignment he participated in the  planning, development, and conduct of major operational and force development  tests and evaluations in direct support of U.S. Army and III Corps combat  requirements. A small sample of these  tests include: the evaluation of the effectiveness of various  firing methodologies of the Cobra (AH-1) attack helicopter; the testing and  evaluation of new camouflage netting, uniforms, and painted vehicles now in use  throughout the Army; the initial U.S.  Army Remotely Piloted Vehicle testing; phosphorous smoke tests; antenna mast  tests; and heat loss/energy conservations tests.</p>

<p>During 1976 through  1978, Hennen was assigned to the 203rd Military Intelligence  Detachment. While there, he served as  Operations NCO and the Chief of both the Tactical and Strategic Exploitation  Divisions, providing imagery collection, exploitation, and intelligence support  to the 1st Calvary Division, the 2nd Armored Division,  the 6th Armored Calvary Regiment, and Headquarters III Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. Hennen had various  assignments from 1979 to 1980.</p>

<p>Chief Hennen was  assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, Arizona,  from 1981 through 1986. He was the  project officer for the Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) Tactical Exploitation of  National Space Capabilities Program (TENCAP), responsible for developing all  training requirements, concept, and doctrine.  His efforts culminated in the production of multi-million dollar  training programs, supporting the fielding of a variety of new systems,  operating at both the tactical and national intelligence levels. During this assignment, Hennen was appointed  as Department of the Army (DA) IMINT subject matter expert. He developed and managed a major project for  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); he authored the U.S. Army Radar  Training Plan; participated in the development of the TENCAP Systems Management  Model; was selected as a member of a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) team that developed the Joint Space  Intelligence and Operations Course; and he represented DA on the DIA Intelligence Training Equipment (ITE)  Subcommittee.</p>

<p>In 1986, Hennen was  selected by the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center to  represent him within the U.S. Army Space Program Office (ASPO) in Washington, D.C.,  for those matters pertaining to TENCAP requirements, concept development, and  the doctrinal and operational employment of TENCAP systems. Additionally, he was a member of various DA,  DOD, and national intelligence community working groups and subcommittees  involved in TENCAP program activities.  Hennen was personally responsible for managing the development and  successful fielding of a state-of -the-art IMINT system to both the European  and Pacific Theaters of Operations.  Chief Hennen&rsquo;s efforts at ASPO were instrumental in the efficient  evolution of 5 major TENCAP systems with a Life Cycle Cost in excess of $2  billion dollars, providing critical and timely intelligence in support of the  requirements of the tactical commander on the extended battlefield.</p>

<p>Chief Hennen was  selected as a payload specialist astronaut candidate in September 1988 and  moved back to the &ldquo;Home of Military Intelligence,&rdquo; Fort Huachuca, Arizona,  during March 1989 to begin Terra Scout payload operations training. During August 1989, Tom was selected as the  primary payload specialist for the Terra Scout experiment manifested on STS-44.  He reported to NASA in 1990 to begin Payload Specialist Astronaut training.</p>

<p>CWO Hennen became the  first Warrant Officer in space, flying aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis  (STS-44), which launched from Kennedy   Space Center,  Pad 39A at 6:44PM (EST), November 24, 1991. He orbited the Earth 109 times traveling 2.9  million miles, before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California on December 1, 1991.</p>

<p>Mr. Hennen retired from  the U.S. Army in December 1995. He is  the co-founder and currently serves as the Executive Director of the Atlantis  Foundation, a non-profit organization that is both an advocate and a service  provider for people with various developmental disabilities. The Foundation was a dream and now the  reality of his devotion to bring about real change, specifically to the severely  mentally challenged. Tom, who after  viewing our planet from a totally different perspective, has rededicated his  life to helping people, especially children who cannot help themselves. He is convinced, now more than ever before,  that the future of our planet will be shaped by all our people.</p>
