<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Fred W. Leslie (Ph.D.)<br />
Payload Specialist</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:  </strong>Born  December 19, 1951, in Ancon, Panama.  Fred  and wife Kathy reside in Huntsville, Alabama.   With more than 5,500 parachute jumps, he enjoys skydiving and has earned  multiple world records as a participant in large freefall formations including  the current record 400-person formation. Leslie is an instrument rated,  multiengine, commercial pilot with more than 1500 hours in various  aircraft.  He also likes motorcycling,  running, and weight training.  </p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>   Graduated from Irving High School, Irving, Texas, in 1970; received a  bachelor of science degree in engineering science from the University of Texas  in 1974, and Master’s and Ph.D. degrees in meteorology with a minor in fluid  mechanics from the University of Oklahoma in 1977 and 1979, respectively.  He continued with post-doctoral studies in  atmospheric science at Purdue University.</p>
<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong>   Served on the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Fluid  Dynamics Technical Committee,  Tau Beta  Pi, Chi Epsilon Pi, the United States Parachute Association, the Association of  Space Explorers, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>   After Dr. Leslie earned his Ph.D. in 1979, he served as a post doctoral  research associate at Purdue University studying fluid vortex dynamics.  In 1980, he worked for the Universities Space  Research Association as a visiting scientist at the Marshall Space Flight  Center (MSFC).</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Leslie began work for NASA in 1980 as a research scientist in the Space  Science Laboratory at MSFC.  He served as  a co-investigator for the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell experiment which examines  spherical rotating convection relevant to the atmospheres of stars and  planets.  The experiment flew on Spacelab  3 and was also part of the United States Microgravity Laboratory-2 (USML-2)  payload.  Leslie was a principal  investigator for the Fluid Interface and Bubble Experiment examining the  behavior of a rotating free surface aboard NASA’s KC-135 aircraft flying  low-gravity trajectories.  He has authored  numerous journal and conference papers, as well as  NASA reports involving atmospheric and fluid  dynamic phenomena.  Leslie also worked in  the MSFC Neutral Buoyancy Simulator as a suited subject and safety diver  supporting procedure tests for extravehicular activity.</p>
<p>In 1987, he  became chief of the Fluid Dynamics Branch where he directed and conducted  research in both laboratory and theoretical investigations along with other  scientists in the Branch.  He was also  the mission scientist for Spacelab J (STS-47) coordinating more than 40  domestic and Japanese experiments in fluid dynamics, crystal growth, and life  science during the 8‑day mission.  In  1994, Leslie became Deputy Chief of the Earth System Science Division at Marshall  before being selected as a payload specialist.</p>
<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Dr. Leslie flew as a payload specialist on  STS-73 launched on October 20, 1995 and landed at the Kennedy Space Center on  November 5, 1995.  The 16-day mission  aboard <em>Columbia</em> focused on materials  science, biotechnology, combustion science, and fluid physics contained within  the pressurized Spacelab module.  He has  logged 382 hours in space.</p>
<p><strong>CURRENT ASSIGNMENT:</strong>  Dr. Leslie is an aerospace engineer at the MSFC  in Huntsville, Alabama.  He is involved  with global atmospheric modeling and turbulence.</p>
