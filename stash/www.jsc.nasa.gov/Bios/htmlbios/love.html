<p> <strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Love  worked summers at the University of Oregon in Eugene  as a computer programming instructor (1984) and as an assistant in physics and  chemistry laboratories (1985 to 1987).   As a graduate teaching assistant at the University  of Washington in Seattle, beginning in  1987, he taught undergraduate courses in general and planetary astronomy.  He worked as a graduate research assistant at  the University of Washington, 1989 to 1993, on a variety of projects including  space propulsion and energy storage, stellar photometry and spectroscopy,  analysis of space-exposed surfaces, hypervelocity impact and particle capture,  atmospheric entry heating of micrometeoroids, infrared imaging of the zodiacal  light and electron microscopy of interplanetary dust particles.  Love moved to the University of Hawaii in  Honolulu in 1994 for postdoctoral research on the formation of meteoritic  chondrules, the collisional evolution of asteroids and the possibility of  meteorites from the planet Mercury.  Love  was awarded a prize postdoctoral fellowship at the California Institute of  Technology in 1995.  His work there  included computational fluid dynamic simulations of asteroid collisions,  calibration of the Cassini spacecraft's dust-particle impact detector and experimental  shock compression of the mineral calcite.   Love transferred to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a staff engineer in  1997 to work on computer models and simulations of spacecraft optical  instrument systems and to participate in a laboratory-wide process  re-engineering effort.</p>
<p> <strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Selected by NASA as an astronaut in June 1998, Love reported for  training in August 1998.  Basic astronaut  candidate training included orientation briefings and tours; scientific and  technical classes; instruction in space shuttle and International Space Station  systems and physiological training, ground school, and water and wilderness  survival instruction to prepare for T-38 flight training.  </p>
<p align="center">  After completion  of the basic syllabus, Love received advanced astronaut training, including spacewalk  classes and suited underwater practice sessions in the Neutral Buoyancy  Laboratory (NBL), coursework and  extensive simulator training to operate the shuttle and station robotic arms,  instruction and qualification as a copilot for the rendezvous and docking of  the shuttle with another orbiting spacecraft and wilderness and cold-weather leadership  and survival training in Alaska, Utah and Canada.  In his first technical assignment (1999),  Love served the Astronaut Office as a representative to the Environmental  Control and Life Support Systems engineering group, preparing for the first  crews aboard the International Space Station.   That work led to an appointment (2000) as a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)  in the Mission Control Center for station Expeditions 1 to 7 and for shuttle  missions STS-104 (ISS-7A), STS-108 (ISS-UF-1) and STS-112 (ISS-9A).  Following the Columbia accident (2003), Love  served in the Astronaut Office&rsquo;s Exploration branch, where he participated in  the Orbital Space Plane Expendable Launch Vehicle Human Flight Safety  Certification Study, helped develop requirements for future human-rated launch  systems, including the Ares I, investigated the polar environment as an analog  for future space missions as a member of the 2004-2005 and 2012-2013 Antarctic  Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) expeditions and served on the Source Evaluation  Board for the pivotal Orion Phase 2 contract.  In 2004, Love and fellow astronaut, Ed Lu,  co-invented the gravity tractor, a novel method to controllably modify the  orbits of hazardous asteroids.  After  STS-122, Love served as Crew Support  astronaut  for the space station Expedition 18 crew and resumed duty as CAPCOM for station  Expeditions 17, 18 and 22 to 26 and for shuttle missions STS-127/ISS-2JA,  STS-128/ISS-17A, STS-129/ISS-ULF3, STS-131/ISS-19A, STS-132/ISS-ULF4,  STS-133/ISS-ULF5, STS-134/ISS-ULF6, and STS-135/ISS-ULF7 (the final shuttle  flight).  After leaving active flight  status in 2010, Love served as a rover crew member in the Desert Research and  Technology Studies simulated lunar surface mission in the Arizona desert and  piloted DeepWorker submersibles for the Pavilion Lake Research Project in  British Columbia.  In 2011, he served as  crew office representative to the Space Launch System program team and  participated in efforts to human-rate the Atlas V rocket.  He reprised his role as sub-pilot for the  16th NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) test, which was  located off Key Largo, Florida, in 2012.   Love worked on a rotational assignment in  NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center's Human  Exploration Development Support Directorate in 2012 and 2013, serving as a crew  representative for space flight analogs and the development of future deep  space exploration missions. He returned to the Astronaut Office in 2014, where  he is again serving as a crew representative for the Space Launch System (SLS)  and continuing to help plan for human exploration of asteroids, the  moon, and Mars.</p>
<p align="center"> <strong>SPACEFLIGHT  EXPERIENCE:  </strong>In 2008, Love  completed his first spaceflight on the crew of STS-122, logging more than 306  hours in space, including more than 15 hours in two spacewalks.  STS-122 Atlantis (February 7  through February 20, 2008) was the 24th shuttle  mission to visit the International Space Station.  The primary objective of the flight was to  carry the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Columbus laboratory module to the space station  and install it there permanently.  Love  performed two spacewalks to help prepare the Columbus laboratory for  installation, to add two science payloads to the outside of Columbus and to  carry a failed ISS gyroscope to the shuttle for return to Earth.  Love's flight duties also included operation  of both the station and shuttle robotic arms.  STS-122 was a crew replacement mission,  delivering Expedition16 flight engineer, European Space Agency astronaut  Léopold Eyharts, and returning home with Expedition16 flight engineer, NASA astronaut  Daniel Tani.  The STS-122 mission was  accomplished in 12 days, 18 hours, 21 minutes and 40 seconds and traveled  5,296,832 statute miles in 203 Earth orbits. </p>
