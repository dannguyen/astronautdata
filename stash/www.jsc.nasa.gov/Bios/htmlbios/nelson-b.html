<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Bill Nelson (Senator)<br />
Payload Specialist</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> A fifth-generation  Floridian, Bill Nelson was born in Miami  on Sept. 29, 1942. He has been married to his wife, Grace, since  1972 and has two grown children, Nan Ellen and Bill Jr.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Educated  in Melbourne's public schools, Bill Nelson is a  graduate of Yale University and the University of  Virginia Law School. He was admitted to  the Florida Bar in 1968.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Bill Nelson  was a Captain in the United States Army, serving in the reserves from 1965 to  1971, and was on active duty from 1968 to 1970.</p>

<p>His  public service career began in 1972, with his election to the Florida  Legislature. During his three terms, he  helped enact the nation&rsquo;s first state law to protect consumers from computer  fraud and advocated for responsible growth management laws.<br />
  Elected  to the U.S. Congress in 1978, he served six terms representing Orlando  and the Space Coast and became an early advocate for a  balanced federal budget.</p>

<p>In  January 1986, Nelson spent six days orbiting Earth as a payload specialist  aboard space shuttle Columbia. That experience gave him a new perspective on  the Earth&rsquo;s fragile environment and a greater appreciation of the importance of  our nation&rsquo;s space exploration program.</p>

<p>In  1994, Nelson was elected to the Florida Cabinet as state Treasurer, Insurance  Commissioner and Fire Marshal. During  his six years in the post, he earned his reputation as a common-sense problem  solver and strong consumer advocate by fighting to keep insurance rates  affordable for homeowners, cracking down on life and burial insurance sales  abuses that targeted the elderly and minorities, and forcing European insurers  to honor unpaid Holocaust-era claims.</p>

<p>Nelson  was elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2000, after serving six years as a  member of the Florida Cabinet. He  currently serves on the Senate Commerce, Armed Services, Budget, Foreign  Relations, Intelligence, and Aging committees and is recognized as the leading  congressional expert on NASA.</p>

<p>As  a member of the Senate&rsquo;s Commerce Committee, Nelson has taken on the cause of  privacy by supporting measures to protect consumers from identity theft and  working on legislation to stop unsolicited e-mails that plague individuals and  businesses.</p>

<p>In  his role on the Senate&rsquo;s Armed Services Committee, Nelson has worked tirelessly  for the families of Florida&rsquo;s  men and women serving overseas by addressing their concerns about basic  equipment needs, such as the lack of body armor, and the hardships facing many  from extended tours of duty. He&rsquo;s also opposed efforts to reduce the military&rsquo;s  aircraft carrier fleet as our nation continues to fight the global threat of  terrorism.</p>

<p>Other  priorities Nelson has championed during his tenure in the Senate include:  preventing oil drilling off Florida&rsquo;s  coast; ensuring veterans and their spouses get the benefits they deserve and  have access to quality health care; and, fighting for a meaningful Medicare  prescription drug benefit for seniors that allows the government to negotiate  lower drug prices from pharmaceutical companies. In the wake of the 2004  hurricane season, he worked to secure adequate federal relief for storm victims  and reform the federal agency charged with assisting people after disasters.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-61C Columbia<em> (</em>January 12-18, 1986) launched from the Kennedy Space Center,  Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the six-day flight the seven-man crew  aboard Columbiadeployed the SATCOM KU satellite and  conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. At mission conclusion Bill Nelson had  traveled over 2.1 million miles in 96 earth orbits and logged over 146 hours in space.</p>
