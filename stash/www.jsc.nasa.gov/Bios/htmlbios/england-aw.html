<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Anthony W. England (Ph.D.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born May 15, 1942, in Indianapolis, Indiana, 
  but his hometown is West Fargo, North Dakota. Married to the former Kathleen 
  Ann Kreutz. They have two daughters. Recreational interests include sailing 
  and amateur radio.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Attended primary school in Indianapolis, Indiana, 
  and graduated from high school in North Dakota; received bachelor and master 
  of science degrees in Geology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
  in 1965, and a doctor of philosophy in Geophysics from MIT in 1970.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Presented the Johnson Space Center Superior 
  Achievement Award (1970). Awarded a NASA Outstanding Scientific Achievement 
  Medal (1973), the U.S. Antarctic Medal (1979), the NASA Space Flight Medal (1985), 
  the American Astronomical Society Space Flight Award (1986), the NASA Exceptional 
  Service Medal (1988), the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer 
  Science Exceptional Service Award for 1994, and the College of Engineering Excellence 
  in Faculty Service Award for 1995. He is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical 
  and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> He was a graduate fellow at the Massachusetts 
  Institute of Technology for the 3 years immediately preceding his first assignment 
  to NASA. He helped develop and use radars to probe the Moon on Apollo 17 and 
  glaciers in Washington State and Alaska, and participated in and led field parties 
  during two seasons in Antarctica. He was Deputy Chief of the Office of Geochemistry 
  and Geophysics for the U.S. Geological Survey, and Associated Editor for the 
  Journal of Geophysical Research. He served on the National Academy's Space Studies 
  Board, and on several Federal Committees concerned with Antarctic policy, nuclear 
  waste containment, and Federal Science and Technology. Dr. England is currently 
  Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Professor of Atmospheric, 
  Oceanic, and Space Science, and Director of the Center for Spatial Analysis 
  at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>He has logged over 3,000 hours of flying time.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. England was selected as a scientist-astronaut 
  by NASA in August 1967. He subsequently completed the initial academic training 
  and a 53-week course in flight training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and 
  served as a support crewman for the Apollo 13 and 16 flights. He left NASA for 
  the U.S. Geological Survey in 1972.</p>

<p>Dr. England returned to the Johnson Space Center in 1979 as a senior scientist-astronaut 
  (mission specialist), was assigned to the operation mission development group 
  of the astronaut office, and eventually managed that group. In 1985 he flew 
  on STS-51F Spacelab-2 in 1985 and has logged 188 hours in space. From May 1986 
  to May 1987 he served as a Program Scientist for Space Station. From June 1987 
  to December 1987 he taught Remote Sensing Geophysics at Rice University. Dr. 
  England retired from NASA in 1988.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-51F Spacelab-2, carrying 
  a 7-man crew, was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985. 
  This mission was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission and the first mission 
  to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major 
  experiments of which 7 were in the field of astronomy and solar physics, 3 were 
  for studies of the Earth's ionosphere, 2 were life science experiments, and 
  1 studied the properties of superfluid helium. During the flight, Dr. England 
  was responsible for activating and operating the Spacelab systems, operating 
  the Instrument Pointing System (IPS), and the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), 
  assisting with experiment operations, and performing a contingency EVA had one 
  been necessary. After 126 orbits of the earth, STS 51-F <i>Challenger</i> landed 
  at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985.</p>
