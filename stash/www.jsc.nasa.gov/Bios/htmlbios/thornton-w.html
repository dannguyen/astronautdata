<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>William Edgar Thornton (M.D.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born in Faison, North Carolina, on April 14, 1929. Married to the former Elizabeth Jennifer Fowler of Hertfordshire, England. They have two sons.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Attended primary and secondary schools in Faison, North Carolina; received a bachelor of science degree in physics and a doctorate in medicine from the University of North Carolina in 1952 and 1963, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Recipient of the Air Force Legion of 
  Merit (1956); the NASA Exceptional Service Medal (1972); the NASA Exceptional 
  Scientific Achievement Medal (1974); the American Astronautical Society&#146;s 
  Melbourne W. Boynton Award for 1975 (1977); two NASA Space Flight Medals (1983, 
  1985); the University of North Carolina Distinguished Alumni Award (1983); the 
  Aerospace Medical Association Randy Lovelace Award (1984); the AIAA Jeffries 
  Medical Research Award (1985); the Association of Military Surgeons of the United 
  States Kern Award (1986); the NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Award 
  (1988).</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Following graduation from the University 
  of North Carolina and having completed Air Force ROTC training, Thornton served 
  as officer-in-charge of the Instrumentation Lab at the Flight Test Air Proving 
  Ground. He later became a consultant to Air Proving Ground Command.</p>

<p>As chief engineer of the electronics division of the Del Mar Engineering Labs 
  at Los Angeles from 1956 to 1959, he also organized and directed its Avionics 
  Division. He returned to the University of North Carolina Medical School in 
  1959, graduated in 1963, and completed internship training in 1964 at the Wilford 
  Hall USAF Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton returned to active duty with the United States Air Force and was 
  then assigned to the USAF Aerospace Medical Division, Brooks Air Force Base, 
  San Antonio, where he completed the Primary Flight Surgeon&#146;s training in 
  1964. It was during his two-year tour of duty there that he became involved 
  in space medicine research and subsequently applied and was selected for astronaut 
  training. Dr. Thornton developed and designed the first mass measuring devices 
  for space, which remain in use today.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton has logged over 2,500 hours pilot flying time in jet aircraft, 
  is currently a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine, University 
  of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, and is an adjunct Professor at University 
  of Houston, Clear Lake.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Thornton was selected as a scientist-astronaut 
  by NASA in August 1967. He completed the required flight training at Reese Air 
  Force Base, Texas. Dr. Thornton was physician crew member on the highly successful 
  Skylab Medical Experiments Altitude Test (SMEAT) -- a 56-day simulation of a 
  Skylab mission enabling crewmen to collect medical experiments baseline data 
  and evaluate equipment, operations, and procedures. Dr. Thornton was also the 
  mission specialist on SMD III, a simulation of a Spacelab life sciences mission.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton was a member of the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, 3, 
  and 4 missions, and principal investigator for Skylab experiments on mass measurement, 
  anthropometric measurements, hemodynamics, and human fluid shifts and physical 
  conditioning. He first documented the shift and loss of fluid changes in body 
  posture size and shape, including increase in height and the rapid loss of muscle 
  strength and mass in space flight.</p>

<p>As a member of the Astronaut Office Operations Missions Development group, Dr. 
  Thornton was responsible for developing crew procedures and techniques for deployable 
  payloads, and for maintenance of crew conditions in flight. He developed advanced 
  techniques for, and made studies in, kinesiology and kinesimetry related to 
  space operations.</p>

<p>During Space Shuttle operations he continued physiological investigations in 
  the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal and neurological areas. He developed 
  the Shuttle treadmill for in-flight exercise and several other on-board devices. 
  His work concentrated on the space adaptation syndrome, with relevant investigations 
  on STS-4, STS-5, STS-6, STS-7, and STS-8.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton holds more than 35 issued patents that range from military weapons 
  systems through the first real-time EKG computer analysis. Space-related items 
  include the first in-flight mass measurement devices, shock and vibration isolation 
  systems, an improved waste collection system, an improved lower body negative 
  pressure (LBNP) apparatus, and others.</p>

<p>A veteran of two space flights, Dr. Thornton has logged over 313 hours in space. 
  He served as a mission specialist on STS-8 in 1983, and STS-51B in 1985.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton continued his work in space medicine while awaiting his next flight 
  opportunity. He worked on problems relative to extending mission durations in 
  the Space Shuttle, in Space Station, and in space exploration, and has designed 
  the necessary exercise and other hardware to support such missions. He continued 
  analysis and publication of results from studies of neurological adaptation, 
  and the study of neuromuscular inhibition following flight, osteoporosis in 
  space and on Earth, and postflight orthostasis. He has completed designs for 
  exercise and other countermeasure equipment for the Extended Duration Orbiter 
  (EDO), and for Space Station Freedom, including improved treadmills, rowing 
  machines, isotonic exercise devices, and a bicycle. Much of this is currently 
  scheduled for flight.</p>

<p>Dr. Thornton retired from NASA effective May 31, 1994.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-8 <i>Challenger</i> (August 
  30 to September 5, 1983). This was the third flight for the Orbiter <i>Challenger</i> 
  and the first mission with a night launch from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 
  and a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the flight 
  Dr. Thornton made almost continuous measurements and investigations of adaptation 
  of the human body to weightlessness, especially of the nervous system and of 
  the space adaptation syndrome. This was a continuation of his previous work 
  in these areas. Much of the equipment used was designed and developed by Dr. 
  Thornton. The mission was accomplished in 98 orbits of the Earth, traveling 
  2.2 million miles in 145 hours, 8 minutes, 4 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-51B/Spacelab-3 <i>Challenger</i> (April 29 to May 6, 1985). The Spacelab-3 
  science mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned 
  to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 7-day flight, Dr. 
  Thornton was responsible for the first animal payload in manned flight and other 
  medical investigations. The mission was accomplished in 110 orbits of the Earth,traveling 
  2.9 million miles in 169 hours and 39 minutes.</p>
