<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Terry J. Hart<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born October 27, 1946, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Married to Mary Jane McKeever
  of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They have a one-year old son, and Terry has two
  adult daughters. Recreational interests include golf and woodworking.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Mt. Lebanon High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1964; received
  a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Lehigh University
    in 1968, a master of science in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in 1969, a master of science in electrical engineering
    from Rutgers University in 1978, and an honorary doctorate of engineering
  from Lehigh University in 1988.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of the
    American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Institute of Electrical
  and Electronic Engineers, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Delta Upsilon.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Awarded the National Defense Medal, NASA
    Space Flight Medal and named Outstanding Officer of Undergraduate Pilot Training
    Class in 1970, Rutgers Distinguished Alumnus Award, Pride of Pennsylvania
  Award, and the New Jersey Distinguished Service Medal.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Hart entered on active duty with the Air Force reserve in June 1969. He completed
      undergraduate pilot training at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, in December
      1970, and from then until 1973, flew F-106 interceptors for the Air Defense
      Command at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, at Loring Air Force Base, Maine,
      and at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. In 1973, he joined the New Jersey
      Air National Guard and continued flying with the Guard until 1985, retiring
      in 1990. He has logged 3,000 hours flying time -- 2,400 hours in jets.
      From 1968 to 1978, Hart was employed as a member of the Technical Staff
      of Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he received 2 patents. Subsequently,
      Hart held a number of engineering management positions at AT&amp;T
  and retired in 2004 as president of Loral Skynet, the Telstar satellite network.
  Professor Hart is currently teaching aerospace engineering at his alma mater,
  Lehigh University.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Mr. Hart was selected
    as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. In August 1979, he completed
    a 1-year training and evaluation period, making him eligible for flight assignment
    on future Space Shuttle crews. Mr. Hart was a member of the support crews
  for STS-1, STS-2, STS-3, and STS-7. He was Ascent and Orbit CAPCOM with the
  Mission Control Team for those flights. Mr. Hart flew as a mission specialist
  on STS-41C (April 6-13, 1984) and has logged a total of 168 hours in space.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS 41-C Challenger launched from
    Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 6, 1984. The crew included Captain
    Robert L. Crippen (spacecraft commander), Mr. F. R. (Dick) Scobee (pilot),
    and fellow mission specialist, Dr. G. D. (Pinky) Nelson and Dr. Jr. D. A.
    (Ox) van Hoften. During this mission the crew successfully deployed the Long
    Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF); retrieved the ailing Solar Maximum Satellite,
    repaired it on board Challenger, and replaced it in orbit using the robot
    arm called the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The mission also included
    flight testing of Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU's) in two extravehicular
    activities (EVA's); operation of the Cinema 360 and IMAX Camera Systems,
    as well as a Bee Hive Honeycomb Structures student experiment. Mission duration
    was 7-days before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April
    13, 1984.</p>
