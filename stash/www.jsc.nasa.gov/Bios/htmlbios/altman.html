<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Altman reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 as an astronaut candidate.&nbsp; He was the pilot on STS-90 (1998) and STS-106 (2000), and the mission commander on STS-109 (2002) and STS-125 (2009).&nbsp; Following two years as Shuttle Branch Chief for the Astronaut Office and lead for the Cockpit Avionics Upgrade, he was assigned on temporary duty to NASA Headquarters as Deputy Director, Requirements Division of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate.&nbsp; On returning to Houston, and following STS-125, he served as the Chief of the Exploration Branch of the Astronaut Office.&nbsp; A veteran of four space flights, Altman has logged over 51 days in space.&nbsp; Altman retired from NASA in September 2010 to join Asrc Research and Technology Solutions in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-90 Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998).&nbsp; During the 16-day Spacelab flight the seven person crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system.</p>

<p>STS-106 Atlantis (September 8-20, 2000).&nbsp; During the 12-day mission, the crew successfully prepared the International Space Station for the arrival of the first permanent crew.</p>

<p>STS-109 Columbia (March 1-12, 2002).&nbsp; STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The STS-109 crew successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope leaving it with a new power unit, a new camera and new solar arrays. HST servicing and upgrade was accomplished during a total of 5 EVAs in 5 consecutive days.&nbsp; STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours, culminating in a night landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.</p>

<p>STS-125 Atlantis (May 11-24, 2009) was the fifth and final Hubble servicing mission.&nbsp; The 19 year old telescope spent seven days in the Shuttle&rsquo;s cargo bay undergoing an overhaul conducted over five back to back spacewalks.&nbsp; The crew overcame frozen bolts, stripped screws, and stuck handrails to complete all mission objectives.&nbsp; The refurbished Hubble Telescope now has four new or rejuvenated scientific instruments, new batteries, new gyroscopes, and a new Command and Data Handling computer. The STS-125 mission traveled over 5.3 million miles in 197 Earth orbits, and ended with a day landing at Edwards AFB following two days of wave offs due to poor weather in Florida.</p>
