<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Frank Borman<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p>A hero of the American Space Odyssey, Frank Borman led the first team of American 
  astronauts to circle the moon, extending man's horizons into space. He is internationally 
  known as Commander of the 1968 Apollo 8 Mission. A romance with airplanes that 
  began when he was 15 years old, took Frank Borman to the Air Force and then 
  to NASA.</p>

<p>A career Air Force officer from 1950, his assignments included 
  service as a fighter pilot, an operational pilot and instructor, an experimental 
  test pilot and an assistant professor of Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics 
  at West Point. When selected by NASA, Frank Borman was instructor at the Aerospace 
  Research Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California.</p>

<p>In 1967 he served as a member of the Apollo 204 Fire Investigation 
  Board, investigating the causes of the fire which killed three astronauts aboard 
  an Apollo spacecraft, reminiscent of the <i>Challenger</i> tragedy. Later he 
  became the Apollo Program Resident Manager, heading the team that re-engineered 
  the Apollo spacecraft. He also served as Field Director of NASA's Space Station 
  Task Force.</p>

<p>Frank Borman retired from the air Force in 1970, but is well 
  remembered as a part of this nation's history, a pioneer in the exploration 
  of space and a veteran of both the Gemini 7, 1965 Space Orbital Rendezvous with 
  Gemini 6 and the first manned lunar orbital mission, Apollo 8, in 1968.</p>

<p>Borman's retirement from the Air Force in 1970 did not end 
  his aviation career. He became a special advisor to Eastern Airlines in early 
  1969 and in December 1970 was named Sr. Vice President-Operations Group.</p>

<p>He was promoted to Executive Vice President-Genera Operations 
  Manager and was elected to Eastern's Board of Directors in July 1974. In May 
  1975 he was elected President and Chief Operating Officer. He was named Chief 
  Executive Officer in December 1975 and became Chairman of the Board in December 
  1976.</p>

<p>During his tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Eastern, the 
  airline industry went through an enormous change caused by deregulation. During 
  this period Eastern originated several unique programs including profit sharing 
  and wages tied to company profitability. These programs produced the four most 
  profitable years in the company's history. A recalcitrant union forced their 
  abandonment in 1983 and the resulting loses led to the sale of the airline to 
  Texas Air Corporation. Colonel Borman retired from Eastern Airlines in June 
  of 1986.</p>

<p>Colonel Borman was privileged to serve as Special Presidential 
  Ambassador on trips throughout the Far East and Europe, including a worldwide 
  tour to seek support for the release of American Prisoners of war held by North 
  Vietnam.</p>

<p>He received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor from the 
  President of the United States. Colonel Borman also was awarded the Harmon International 
  Aviation Trophy, the Robert J. Collier Trophy, the Tony Jannus Award and the 
  National Geographic Society's Hubbard Medal--in addition to many honorary degrees, 
  special honors and service decorations. More recently, in September of 1990, 
  Colonel Borman along with fellow Apollo 8 astronauts, Lovell and Anders, was 
  inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame. And in October of 1990 
  received the Airport Operators Council International Downes Award. In March 
  1993, he was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Frank Borman was born in Gary, Indiana, and was raised in Tucson, 
  Arizona. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Military Academy, 
  West Point, in 1950 and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering 
  from the California Institute of Technology in 1957. He completed the Harvard 
  Business School's Advanced Management Program in 1970.</p>

<p>Frank Borman is currently a member of the Board of Directors 
  of the Home Depot, National Geographic, Outboard Marine Corporation, Auto Finance 
  Group, Thermo Instrument Systems and American Superconductor. He was named Chief 
  Executive Office of Patlex Corporation in the spring of 1988, and presently 
  holds the titles of Chairman, CEO and President of that Corporation. He has 
  written an autobiography entitled <i>Countdown: An Autobiography&nbsp; of Frank 
  Borman </i> with Robert J. Serling, released October of 1988 and published by 
  Silver Arrow Books, William Morrow and Company, Inc.</p>

<p>He is married to the former Susan Bugbee of Tucson, Arizona. 
  They have two sons, Frederick and Edwin, and four grandchildren. Frank and Susan 
  presently reside in Las Cruces, New Mexico.</p>
