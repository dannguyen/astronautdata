<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>   He graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute in 1984 with a degree in  engineering and a specialization in creating mathematical models related to  mechanical flight.  He is currently doing  graduate work in his field of research.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> After graduating from the Aviation  Institute he began working at the Energia corporation as an engineer.  The main subjects of his job have been  dynamics, ballistics, and software development.   His personal scientific research is connected with the psychological  aspects of cosmonauts' training for the manual control of spacecraft  motion.  In 1993 he was selected to begin  cosmonaut training, and in 1998 he started training as a flight engineer for  the Expedition-3 crew.  He also served as  a backup crew member for the first ISS mission.  </p>
<p>Tyurin lived and  worked aboard the International Space Station for a total of 125 days.  The Expedition-3 crew launched on August 10, 2001  aboard STS-105 <em>Discovery</em> and docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on August 12, 2001.  They left the station on December 15 aboard STS-108 <em>Endeavour</em>, landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 17, 2001.  </p>
<p>Tyurin was the  Commander of Soyuz-13 (TMA-9) /  Expedition 14, launching on September 18, 2006 from Baikonour, and docking with the  International Space Station on September 20, 2006.  He served as Flight Engineer during a  six-month tour of duty aboard the space station.   Tyurin  performed 5 spacewalks accumulating 25 hours and 32 minutes of EVA time and a  total of 215 days in space.  The mission concluded  on April 21, 2007  with a landing in the steppes of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p> Expedition 38/39 (November  7, 2103 to May 14, 2014).  Tyurin  launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space  Station along with NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio and Japan Aerospace  Exploration Agency (JAXA) Flight Engineer Koichi Wakata.  Upon reaching the station, they joined  Roscosmos cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg and Luca  Parmitano of the European Space Agency (ESA), plus Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg  Kotov and Sergey Ryazanskiy and NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins.  Tyurin, Mastracchio and Wakata returned to  Earth after 188 days in space. During the expedition, the crew completed 3,008  orbits of the Earth and traveled more than 79.8 million miles.</p>
<p> In completing his third space  mission, Tyurin has accumulated a total of 532 days in space including 25 hours  and 32 minutes of EVA time in 5 spacewalks.</p>
