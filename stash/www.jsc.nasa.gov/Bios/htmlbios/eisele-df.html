  Ohio; received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy 
  in 1952 and a Master of Science degree in Astronautics in 1960 from the Air 
  Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of Tau Beta Pi, National Engineering 
  Society.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Eisele graduated from the United States Naval 
  Academy and chose a career in the Air Force. He is also a graduate of the Air 
  Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California.</p>

<p>He was a project engineer and experimental test pilot at the Air Force Special 
  Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. In this capacity, he 
  flew experimental test flights in support of special weapons development programs.</p>

<p>He logged more than 4,200 hours flying time&#8212;3,600 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Eisele was one of the third group of 
  astronauts selected by NASA in October 1963.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1968, he occupied the command module pilot seat for the eleven-day
  flight of Apollo VII&#8212;the first manned flight test of the third generation
  United States spacecraft. With spacecraft commander Walter M. Schirra, Jr.,
  and lunar module pilot Walter Cunningham, Eisele participated in and executed
  maneuvers enabling the crew to perform exercises in transposition and docking
  and lunar orbit rendezvous with the S-IVB stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle;
  completed eight successful test and maneuvering ignitions of the service module
  propulsion engine; measured the accuracy of performance of all spacecraft systems;
  and provided the first effective television transmissions of onboard crew activities.</p>

<p>Apollo VII was placed in an earth-orbit with an apogee of 153.5 nautical miles 
  and perigee of 122.6 nautical miles; and the 260-hour, four-and-a-half million 
  mile shakedown flight was successfully concluded on October 22, 1968, with splashdown 
  occurring in the Atlantic, some eight miles from the carrier ESSEX (only three-tenths 
  of a mile from the originally predicted aiming point).</p>

<p>He served as backup command module pilot for the Apollo X flight.</p>

<p>Colonel Eisele logged 260 hours in space.</p>

<p>In July 1972, Colonel Eisele retired from the Air Force and left the space
  program to become Director of the U.S. Peace Corps in Thailand. Upon Returning
  from Thailand, Eisele became Sales Manager for Marion Power Shovel Company,
  a division of Dresser Industries. Eisele handled private and corporate accounts
  for the investment firm of Oppenheimer &amp; Company.</p>
