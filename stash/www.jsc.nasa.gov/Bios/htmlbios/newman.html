<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>James H. Newman (Ph.D.)<br />
NASA ASTRONAUT (FORMER)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born October 16, 1956, in the Trust Territory of the  Pacific Islands (now the Federated States of   Micronesia), but considers San Diego, California,  to be his hometown. Married to Mary Lee  Pieper. Three children. His mother, Ms. Ruth Hansen, and his  father, Dr. William Newman, are both residents of San Diego.  Mary Lee&rsquo;s parents, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wylie Bernard Pieper, reside in Houston, Texas.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from La Jolla High School, San Diego,  California in 1974; received a bachelor of  arts degree in physics from Dartmouth College in 1978, a master of arts degree and a  doctorate in physics from Rice   University in 1982 and  1984, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member  of the American Physical Society, Sigma Xi, and American Institute of  Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Selected  by NASA JSC to attend the 1989 summer session of the International  Space University  in Strasbourg, France. Awarded  the 1995 Superior Achievement Award by the Institute of Navigation  for &quot;outstanding accomplishments as a Practical Navigator&quot; for his  work on GPS (Global Positioning  System) on the Space Shuttle. 1996  NASA Exceptional Service Medal.  Recipient of the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award  (1994, 1999) for his work as a member of the STS-51  and STS-88 crews. As the leader of the Space Vision System  Development Team, Newman shared the 2001 Rotary National Award for Space  Achievement Foundation's Team Award and shared a 2002 NASA Group Achievement  Award to the Space Vision System Team.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> After  graduating from Rice   University in 1984, Dr.  Newman did an additional year of post-doctoral work at Rice. In 1985, Dr. Newman was appointed as adjunct  professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University. That same year he came to work at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center,  where his duties included responsibility for conducting flight crew and flight  control team training for all mission phases in the areas of Orbiter  propulsion, guidance, and control. When  selected for the astronaut program he was working as a simulation supervisor  responsible for a team of instructors conducting flight controller training.</p>

<p>Selected by NASA in  January 1990, Dr. Newman began astronaut training in July 1990. His technical assignments since then  include: Astronaut Office Mission  Support Branch where he was part of a team responsible for crew  ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing; Mission  Development Branch working on the Shuttle on-board laptop computers; Chief of  the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch responsible for crew involvement  in the development and use of computers on the Space Shuttle and Space  Station.</p>

<p>While still assigned to  the Astronaut Office Dr. Newman has also worked in various assignments at  NASA. Detailed to the Space Shuttle Program Office from March 1999 to March  2001, Newman served as the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) Integration Manager  responsible for the Orbiter Canadian robotic arm and the Space Vision  System.</p>

<p>Dr Newman was detailed to the International Space Station (ISS)  Program Office from December 2002 through January 2006, serving as NASA&rsquo;s  Director, Human Space Flight Program, Russia. As the ISS Program Manager&rsquo;s lead  representative to the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) and its contractors,  his responsibilities included oversight of NASA&rsquo;s human space flight program in  Russia. This included NASA operations, logistics, and  technical functions in Moscow, at NASA&rsquo;s Mission Control  Center operations in Korolev, and  NASA&rsquo;s crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training  Center in Star City.</p>

<p>In March  2006, Dr. Newman was detailed to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California,  as a NASA Visiting Professor in the NPS Space Systems Academic Group. Dr. Newman left NASA in July 2008 to accept  a position as Professor, Space Systems at NPS to continue his involvement in  teaching and research, with an emphasis on using very small satellites in  hands-on education and for focused research projects of national interest.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Newman flew as a mission specialist on STS-51  (1993), STS-69 (1995), STS-88 (1998) and STS-109  (2002). A veteran of four space flights,  Dr. Newman has logged over 43 days in space, including six spacewalks totaling  43 hours and 13 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-51 Discovery,  (September 12-22, 1993) was launched from and returned to make the first night  landing at Kennedy Space Center,   Florida. During the ten-day flight, the crew of five  deployed the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) and the  Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer on the  Shuttle Pallet Satellite (ORFEUS/SPAS).  Newman was responsible for the operation of the SPAS, was the backup  operator for the RMS, and on flight day five conducted a seven-hour,  five-minute spacewalk with Carl Walz.  The extravehicular activity (EVA) tested tools and techniques for use on  future missions. In addition to working  with numerous secondary payloads and medical test objectives, the crew  successfully tested a Global Positioning System (GPS)  receiver to determine real-time Shuttle positions and velocities and completed  a test routing Orbiter data to on-board laptop computers. STS-51  made 158 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.1 million miles in 236 hours and 11  minutes.</p>

<p>STS-69 Endeavour (September  7-18, 1995), was an eleven-day mission during which the crew successfully  deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility  (WSF). Also on board was the  International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payload, numerous secondary  payloads, and medical experiments.  Newman was responsible for the crew&rsquo;s science involvement with the WSF  and was also the primary RMS operator on the flight, performing the WSF and EVA  RMS operations. He also operated the  on-orbit tests of the Ku-band Communications Adaptor, the Relative GPS experiment, and the RMS Manipulator Positioning  Display. The mission was accomplished in  171 Earth orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 260 hours, 29 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-88 Endeavour (December  4-15, 1998), was the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the twelve-day mission the Unity  module was mated with Zarya module.  Newman performed three spacewalks with Jerry Ross, totaling 21 hours, 22  minutes. The primary objective of the  spacewalks was to connect external power and data umbilicals between Zarya and  Unity. Other objectives include setting  up the Early Communication antennas, deploying antennas on Zarya that had failed  to deploy as expected, installing a sunshade to protect an external computer,  installing translation aids, and attaching tools/hardware for use in future  EVA&rsquo;s. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC)  operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1, sponsored by the Air Force,  and SAC-A, from Argentina. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of  the Earth, traveling 4.6 million miles in 283 hours and 18 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-109 Columbia  (March 1-12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST)  servicing mission and the 108th flight of the Space Shuttle. The crew of STS-109  successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope with new solar arrays, a new  power control unit, and a new camera, and also installed a cooler to reactivate  an old infrared camera. This work was  accomplished during a total of five spacewalks in five consecutive days. Dr. Newman performed two spacewalks with  crewmate Mike Massimino, totaling 14 hours and 46 minutes. During the first of these spacewalks, Newman  and Massimino replaced an old solar array and a reaction wheel assembly with  new units. During their second spacewalk  they replaced the old Faint Object Camera with the state-of-the-art Advanced  Camera for Surveys, producing a ten-fold increase in Hubble's imaging  capability. STS-109  orbited the Earth 165 times, traveling 3.9 million miles in 262 hours and 10 mminutes.</p>
