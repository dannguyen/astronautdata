<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Robert F. Overmyer (Colonel, USMC, Ret.)<br /> 
NASA Astronaut (Deceased)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born July 14, 1936, in Lorain, Ohio, but considered Westlake, Ohio, his 
    hometown. Died March 22, 1996. He is survived by his wife, Katherine, and 
    three children. Hobbies included skiing, water skiing, boating, acrobatic 
    flying in open cockpit biplanes, coaching baseball, and running.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Attended and graduated from Westlake High School, Westlake, Ohio, in 1954. 
    Received a bachelor of science degree in Physics from Baldwin Wallace College 
    in 1958. Received a master of science degree in Aeronautics with a major in 
    Aeronautical Engineering from the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1964.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Experimental Aircraft 
    Association, and Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Awarded the USAF Meritorious Service Medal in 1969 for duties with the 
    USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program; awarded the USMC Meritorious Service 
    Medal in 1978 for duties as the Chief Chase Pilot and support crewman for 
    the Shuttle Approach and Landing Test Program; received an Honorary Doctor 
    of Philosophy degree from Baldwin Wallace College, December 1982; awarded 
    the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School Distinguished Engineers Award, January 
    1983; the USMC Distinguished Flying Cross (1983); and the NASA Space Flight 
    Medal (1983).</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Colonel Overmyer entered active duty with the Marine Corps in January 1958. 
    After completing Navy flight training in Kingsville, Texas, he was assigned 
    to Marine Attack Squadron 214 in November 1959. Colonel Overmyer was assigned 
    to the Naval Postgraduate School in 1962 to study aeronautical engineering. 
    Upon completion of his graduate studies, he served 1 year with Marine Maintenance 
    Squadron 17 in Iwakuni, Japan. He was then assigned to the Air Force Test 
    Pilots School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Colonel Overmyer was 
    chosen as an astronaut for the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program in 
    1966. The program was canceled in 1969. Colonel Overmyer has over 7,500 flight 
    hours with over 6,000 in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> He was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1969 after the MOL Program was canceled. 
    His first assignment with NASA was engineering development duties on the Skylab 
    Program from 1969 until November 1971. From November 1971 until December 1972, 
    he was a support crew member for Apollo 17 and was the launch capsule communicator. 
    From January 1973 until July 1975, he was a support crew member for the Apollo-Soyuz 
    Test Project and was the NASA capsule communicator in the mission control 
    center in Moscow, USSR. In 1976, he was assigned duties on the Space Shuttle 
    Approach and Landing Test (ALT) Program and was the prime T-38 chase pilot 
    for Orbiter Free-Flights 1 and 3. In 1979 Colonel Overmyer was assigned as 
    the Deputy Vehicle Manager of OV-102 (<i>Columbia</i>) in charge of finishing 
    the manufacturing and tiling of <i>Columbia</i> at the Kennedy Space Center 
    preparing it for its first flight. This assignment lasted until <i>Columbia</i> 
    was transported to the launch pad in 1980.</p>

<p>Colonel Overmyer was the pilot for STS-5, the first fully operational 
      flight of the Shuttle Transportation System, which launched from Kennedy 
      Space Center, Florida, on November 11, 1982. He was accompanied by spacecraft 
      commander, Vance D. Brand, and two mission specialists, Dr. Joseph P. Allen 
      and Dr. William B. Lenoir. STS-5, the first mission with a four-man crew, 
      clearly demonstrated the Space Shuttle as fully operational by the successful 
      first deployment of two commercial communications satellites from the Orbiter&#146;s 
      payload bay. The mission marked the first use of the Payload Assist Module 
      (PAM-D), and its new ejection system. Numerous flight tests were performed 
      throughout the mission to document Shuttle performance during launch, boost, 
      orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases. STS-5 was the last flight to 
      carry the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package to support flight 
      testing. A Getaway Special, three Student Involvement Projects and medical 
      experiments were included on the mission. The STS-5 crew successfully concluded 
      the 5-day orbital flight of <i>Columbia</i> with the first entry and landing 
      through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway and demonstrated maximum braking. 
      Mission duration was 122 hours before landing on a concrete runway at Edwards 
      Air Force Base, California, on November 16, 1982.</p>

<p>Colonel Overmyer was the commander of STS 51-B, the Spacelab-3 (SL-3) 
      mission. He commanded a crew of 4 astronauts and 2 payload specialists conducting 
      a broad range of scientific experiments from space physics to the suitability 
      of animal holding facilities. Mission 51-B was also the first Shuttle flight 
      to launch a small payload from the -Getaway Special&#148; canisters. Mission 
      51-B launched at 12:02 p.m. EDT on April 29, 1985 from Kennedy Space Center, 
      Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 9:07 a.m. 
      PDT on May 6, 1985. Mission 51-B completed 110 orbits of the earth at an 
      altitude of 190 n.m.</p>

<p>Colonel Overmyer retired from NASA and the Marine Corps in May 1986.</p>

<p>Colonel Overmyer died on March 22, 1996, in the crash of a light aircraft 
      he was testing.</p>
