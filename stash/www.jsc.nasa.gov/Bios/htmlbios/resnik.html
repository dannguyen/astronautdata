  NASA ASTRONAUT (DECEASED)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born April 5, 1949, in Akron, Ohio. 
  Died January 28, 1986. Unmarried. She was a classical pianist and also enjoyed 
  bicycling, running, and flying during her free time.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Firestone High School, Akron, 
  Ohio, in 1966; received a bachelor of science degree in Electrical Engineering 
  from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1970, and a doctorate in Electrical Engineering 
  from the University of Maryland in 1977.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of the Institute of Electrical 
  and Electronic Engineers; American Association for the Advancement of Science; 
  IEEE Committee on Professional Opportunities for Women; American Association 
  of University Women; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Tau 
  Beta Pi; Eta Kappa Nu; Mortarboard; Senior Member of the Society of Women Engineers.</p>

<p><strong>AWARDS:</strong> Posthumously awarded the Congressional Space 
  Medal of Honor.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Graduate Study Program Award, RCA, 
  1971; American Association of University Women Fellow, 1975-1976. NASA Space 
  Flight Medal, 1984.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Upon graduating from Carnegie-Mellon University 
  in 1970, she was employed by RCA located in Moorestown, New Jersey; and in 1971, 
  she transferred to RCA in Springfield, Virginia. Her projects while with RCA 
  as a design engineer included circuit design and development of custom integrated 
  circuitry for phased-array radar control systems; specification, project management, 
  and performance evaluation of control system equipment; and engineering support 
  for NASA sounding rocket and telemetry systems programs. She authored a paper 
  concerning design procedures for special-purpose integrated circuitry.</p>

<p>Dr. Resnik was a biomedical engineer and staff fellow in the 
  Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, 
  Maryland, from 1974 to 1977, where she performed biological research experiments 
  concerning the physiology of visual systems. Immediately preceding her selection 
  by NASA in 1978, she was a senior systems engineer in product development with 
  Xerox Corporation at El Segundo, California.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected as an astronaut candidate 
  by NASA in January 1978, she completed a 1-year training and evaluation period 
  in August 1979. Dr. Resnik worked on a number of projects in support of Orbiter 
  development, including experiment software, the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), 
  and training techniques.</p>

<p>Dr. Resnik first flew as a mission specialist on STS 41-D 
  which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984. She 
  was accompanied by spacecraft commander Hank Hartsfield, pilot Mike Coats, fellow 
  mission specialists, Steve Hawley and Mike Mullane, and payload specialist Charlie 
  Walker. This was the maiden flight of the orbiter Discovery. During this 7-day 
  mission the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, 
  deployed three satellites, SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and TELSTAR 3-C, operated the 
  CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, and photography 
  experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera. The crew earned the name &quot;Icebusters&quot; 
  in successfully removing hazardous ice particles from the orbiter using the 
  Remote Manipulator System. STS 41-D completed 96 orbits of the earth before 
  landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984. With the 
  completion of this flight she logged 144 hours and 57 minutes in space.</p>

<p>Dr. Resnik was a mission specialist on STS 51-L which was 
  launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 11:38:00 EST on January 
  28, 1986. The crew on board the Orbiter <i>Challenger</i> included the spacecraft 
  commander, Mr. F.R. Scobee, the pilot, Commander M.J. Smith (USN), fellow mission 
  specialists, Dr. R.E. McNair, and Lieutenant Colonel E.S. Onizuka (USAF), as 
  well as two civilian payload specialists, Mr. G.B. Jarvis and Mrs. S. C. McAuliffe. 
  The STS 51-L crew died on January 28, 1986 when <i>Challenger</i> exploded after 
  launch.</p>
