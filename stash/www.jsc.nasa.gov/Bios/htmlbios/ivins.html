<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Marsha S. Ivins<br />
NASA Astronaut</strong> (FORMER)</p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL  DATA:</strong>  Born April 15, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland.  </p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Nether  Providence High   School, Wallingford, Pennsylvania, in 1969; received a bachelor of science  degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado  in 1973.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Ms. Ivins was employed at the Lyndon  B. Johnson  Space Center beginning July 1974, working as an engineer for orbiter displays and  controls and man machine engineering, and development of the Orbiter Heads-Up Display (HUD).  In 1980, she was assigned as a flight  engineer on the Shuttle Training Aircraft (Aircraft Operations) and a co-pilot  in the NASA administrative aircraft    (Gulfstream-1).   Ms. Ivins was selected in the NASA  Astronaut Class of 1984 as a mission specialist.  </p>
<p>Ms. Ivins  holds a multi-engine Airline Transport Pilot License with Gulfstream-1 type  rating, single engine airplane, land, sea, and glider commercial licenses, and  airplane, instrument, and glider flight instructor ratings.  She has logged over 7000  hours in civilian and NASA aircraft.  </p>
<p>A veteran of  five space flights, (STS-32 in  1990, STS-46 in 1992, STS-62 in 1994, STS-81  in 1997, and STS-98 in 2001), Ms. Ivins has logged over 1,318 hours  in space.</p>
<p>Ms.  Ivins was assigned to the Astronaut Office supporting the Space Shuttle, Space  Station and Constellation Branches.  She departed NASA on December 31,  2010.</p>
<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-32  (January 9-20, 1990) launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on an  eleven-day flight, during which crew members on board the Orbiter Columbiasuccessfully deployed a Syncom  satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility  (LDEF).  Mission  duration was 261 hours, 1 minute, and 38 seconds.  Following 173 orbits of the Earth and 4.5  million miles, Columbia returned with a night  landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.</p>
<p>STS-46 (July  31-August 8, 1992) was an 8-day mission, during which crew members deployed the  European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) satellite, and conducted the first  Tethered Satellite System (TSS)  test flight.  Mission  duration was 191 hours, 16  minutes, and 7 seconds.  Space Shuttle  Atlantis and her crew launched and landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida,  completing 126 orbits of the Earth in 3.35 million miles.</p>
<p>STS-62 (March 4-18,  1994) was a 14-day mission for the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP) 2  and Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST) 2 payloads.  These payloads studied the effects of  microgravity on materials sciences and other space flight technologies.  Other experiments on board included  demonstration of advanced teleoperator tasks using the remote manipulator  system, protein crystal growth, and dynamic behavior of space structures.  Mission  duration was 312 hours, 23 minutes, and 16 seconds.  Space Shuttle Columbia launched and landed at the Kennedy  Space Center, Florida, completing 224 orbits in 5.82 million miles.</p>
<p>STS-81 Atlantis  (January 12-22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia’s Space Station Mir, and the second to  exchange U.S.  astronauts.  The mission also carried the  Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary  experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food,  water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back  and forth between the two spacecraft.   Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81  mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy   Space Center’s  Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey.   Mission duration was 244 hours, 56  minutes.</p>
<p>STS-98 Atlantis(February 7-20, 2001) continued the  task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering  the U.S.  laboratory module Destiny.  The Shuttle  spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached and three  spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly.  The crew also relocated a docking port, and  delivered supplies and equipment to the resident Expedition-1 crew.  Space Shuttle Atlantis returned to land at  Edwards Air Force Base, California  traveling 5.3 million miles in 203 orbits.   Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours,  20 minutes.  </p>
