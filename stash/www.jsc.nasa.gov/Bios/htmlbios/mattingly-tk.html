<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Thomas K. Mattingly II (Rear Admiral, USN, Ret.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born in Chicago, Illinois, March 17, 1936. 
  One grown son.</p>

  schools and is a graduate of Miami Edison High School, Miami, Florida; received 
  a bachelor of science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Auburn University in 1958.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Associate Fellow, American Institute of 
  Aeronautics and Astronautics; Fellow, American Astronautical Society; and Member, 
  Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and the U.S. Naval Institute.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Department of Defense Distinguished Service 
  Medal (1982); NASA Distinguished Service Medals (2); JSC Certificate of Commendation 
  (1970); JSC Group Achievement Award (1972); Navy Distinguished Service Medal; 
  Navy Astronaut Wings; SETP Ivan C. Kincheloe Award (1972); Delta Tau Delta Achievement 
  Award (1972); Auburn Alumni Engineers Council Outstanding Achievement Award 
  (1972); AAS Flight Achievement Award for 1972; AIAA Haley Astronautics Award 
  for 1973; Federation Aeronautique Internationale's V. M. Komarov Diploma in 1973.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Prior to reporting for duty at the Lyndon 
  B. Johnson Space Center, he was a student at the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School.</p>

<p>Mattingly began his Naval career as an Ensign in 1958 and received his wings 
  in 1960. He was then assigned to VA-35 and flew A1H aircraft aboard the USS 
  SARATOGA from 1960 to 1963. In July 1963, he served in VAH-11 deployed aboard 
  the USS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT where he flew the A3B aircraft for two years.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Mattingly is one of the 19 astronauts 
  selected by NASA in April 1966.</p>

<p>He served as a member of the astronaut support crews for the Apollo 8 and 11 
  missions and was the astronaut representative in development and testing of 
  the Apollo spacesuit and backpack (EMU).</p>

<p>He was designated command module pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was removed 
  from flight status 72 hours prior to the scheduled launch due to exposure to 
  the German measles.</p>

<p>He has logged 7,200 hours of flight time -- 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p>From January 1973 to March 1978, Mattingly worked as head of astronaut office 
  support to the STS (Shuttle Transportation System) program. He was next assigned 
  as technical assistant for flight test to the Manager of the Orbital Flight 
  Test Program. From December 1979 to April 1981, he headed the astronaut office 
  ascent/entry group. He subsequently served as backup commander for STS-2 and 
  STS-3, <i>Columbia</i>'s second and third orbital test flights. From June 1983 
  through May 1984, Mattingly served as Head of the Astronaut Office DOD Support 
  Group.</p>

<p>A veteran of three space flights, Mattingly has logged 504 hours in space, including 
  1 hour and 13 minutes of EVA (extravehicular activity) during his Apollo 16 
  flight. He was the command module pilot on Apollo 16 (April 16-27, 1972), was 
  the spacecraft commander on STS-4 (June 26 to July 4, 1982) and STS 51-C (January 
  24-27, 1985).</p>

<p>Captain Mattingly resigned from NASA in 1985.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Apollo 16 (April 16-27, 1972) 
  was the fifth manned lunar landing mission. The crew included John W. Young 
  (spacecraft commander), Ken Mattingly (command module pilot), and Charles M. 
  Duke, Jr. (lunar module pilot). The mission assigned to Apollo 16 was to collect 
  samples from the lunar highlands at a location near the crater Descartes. While 
  in lunar orbit the scientific instruments aboard the command and service module 
  &quot;Casper&quot; extended the photographic and geochemical mapping of a belt 
  around the lunar equator. Twenty-six separate scientific experiments were conducted 
  both in lunar orbit and during cislunar coast. Major emphasis was placed on 
  using man as an orbital observer capitalizing on the human eye's unique capabilities 
  and man's inherent curiosity. Although the mission of Apollo 16 was terminated 
  one day early, due to concern over several spacecraft malfunctions, all major 
  objectives were accomplished through the ceaseless efforts of the mission support 
  team and were made possible by the most rigorous preflight planning yet associated 
  with an Apollo mission.</p>

<p>STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test flight of the Shuttle <i>Columbia</i>, 
  launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 27,1982. Mattingly was 
  the spacecraft commander and Henry W. Hartsfield, Jr., was the pilot. This 7-day 
  mission was designed to: further verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; 
  perform continued studies of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the 
  Orbiter subsystems; and conduct a survey of Orbiter-induced contamination on 
  the Orbiter payload bay. Additionally, the crew operated several scientific 
  experiments located in the Orbiter's cabin and in the payload bay. These experiments 
  included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System experiment designed to investigate 
  the separation of biological materials in a fluid according to their surface 
  electrical charge. This experiment was a pathfinder for the first commercial 
  venture to capitalize on the unique characteristics of space. The crew is also 
  credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled them to activate the 
  first operational &quot;Getaway Special&quot; (composed of nine experiments 
  that ranged from algae and duckweed growth in space to fruit fly and brine shrimp 
  genetic studies). STS-4 completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing on 
  a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on July 4, 1982.</p>

<p>STS-51C <i>Discovery</i>, the first Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, 
  launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 24, 1985. The crew included 
  Ken Mattingly (spacecraft commander), Loren Shriver (pilot), Jim Buchli and 
  Ellison Onizuka (mission specialists), and Gary Payton (DOD payload specialist). 
  STS-51C performed its DOD mission which included deployment of a modified Inertial 
  Upper Stage (IUS) vehicle from the Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i>. Landing occurred 
  on January 27, 1985.</p>
