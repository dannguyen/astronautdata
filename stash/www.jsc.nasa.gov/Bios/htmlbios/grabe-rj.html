<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Ronald J. Grabe (Colonel, USAF, Ret.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born June 13, 1945, in New York, New York. 
  Married to the former Lynn O'Keefe of Ottawa, Canada. Ron has two daughters 
  and he and Lynn have a son. Recreational interests include skiing, wind surfing, 
  and racquet sports.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Stuyvesant High School, New 
  York, New York, in 1962, received a bachelor of science degree in engineering 
  science from the United States Air Force Academy in 1966; studied aeronautics 
  as a Fulbright Scholar at the Technische Hochschule, Darmstadt, West Germany, in 1967.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> The Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, 
  the Air Medal with 7 Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, 
  the Liethen-Tittle Award (for Outstanding Student at the USAF Test Pilot School), 
  the Royal Air Force Cross, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and NASA Space Flight Medals.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Upon graduating from the Air Force Academy 
  in 1966, Grabe went to Darmstadt, West Germany, as a Fulbright Scholar. He returned 
  to the States in 1967 to complete pilot training at Randolph Air Force Base, 
  Texas. He subsequently flew F-100 aircraft with the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing 
  at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and in 1969 was assigned as an F-100 pilot 
  with the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing at Bien Hoa Air Base in the Republic of Vietnam 
  where he flew 200 combat missions. In 1970, he was reassigned to the 27th Tactical 
  Fighter Wing at Cannon Air Force Base to fly F-100 and F-111 aircraft. He participated 
  in the operational test and evaluation of the weapons system of the F-111D aircraft. 
  Grabe attended the USAF Test Pilot School in 1974 and, upon graduating in 1975, 
  was assigned to the Air Force Flight Test Center as a test pilot for the A-7 
  and F-111. He was the program manager and chief project pilot for the Air Force's 
  digital flight control system for tactical fighters (DIGITAC) evaluation. He 
  later served as an exchange test pilot with the Royal Air Force at Boscombe 
  Down, United Kingdom, from 1976 to 1979. During this tour of duty, he served 
  as the chief project pilot for the Royal Air Force Harrier and the Royal Navy 
  Sea Harrier. He was an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air 
  Force Base, California, when advised of his selection by NASA.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 5,500 hours flying time.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Grabe became a NASA astronaut in August 
  1981. He has served as a chief verification pilot for STS-3 and STS-4 entry 
  guidance, navigation and control simulation testing; as the Deputy Manager for 
  Operations Integration, Space Shuttle Program Office; and subsequently as the 
  Chief of Training within the Astronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, 
  Grabe served as pilot on STS 51-J (October 3-7, 1985) and STS-30 (May 4-8, 1989), 
  and was the mission commander on STS-42 (January 22-30, 1992) and STS-57 (June 
  21 to July 1,1993). Grabe has logged over 627 hours in space. Effective April 
  11, 1994, Grabe left NASA and the Air Force to join Orbital Sciences Corporation, 
  Dulles, Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-51J, the second Space Shuttle 
  Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 
  on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the <i>Atlantis</i>, the final 
  Orbiter in the Shuttle fleet. After 98 hours of orbital operations, <i>Atlantis</i> 
  landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985. Mission duration 
  was 97 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-30 <i>Atlantis</i> launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 
  1989. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Magellan 
  Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched 
  since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan 
  arrived at Venus in mid-1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. Magellan 
  has been one of NASA's most successful scientific missions and continues to 
  operate today gaining information about the Venetian atmosphere and magnetic 
  field. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving 
  fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 
  64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards 
  Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989. Mission duration was 96 hours, 57 
  minutes, 35 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-42 <i>Discovery</i> launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 
  January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International 
  Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven 
  countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 
  128 orbits of the Earth, the seven-person crew accomplished the mission's primary 
  objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing 
  and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, the crew worked around-the-clock 
  in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth 
  of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects 
  of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response 
  were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards 
  Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Mission duration was 193 hours, 
  14 minutes, 45 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-57 <i>Endeavour</i> launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 
  June 21, 1993. The primary mission of this flight was the retrieval of the European 
  Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA). Additionally, STS-57 featured the first 
  flight of the Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module 
  for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual 
  flight experiments in materials processing and human factors. A spacewalk was 
  conducted on this flight as part of an ongoing program to evaluate extravehicular 
  activity (EVA) techniques for future missions. The Space Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i> 
  landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 10 days on orbit. 
  Mission duration was 239 hours, 45 minutes.</p>
