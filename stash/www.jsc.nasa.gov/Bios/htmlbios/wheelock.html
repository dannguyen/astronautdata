    <p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Colonel Wheelock received his commission as
      a Second Lieutenant in the Army Infantry from West Point in May 1983.  He
      entered flight school in 1984, graduated at the top of his flight class
      and was designated as an Army Aviator in September 1984.  He served in the
      Pacific Theater as a combat aviation Section Leader, Platoon Leader,
      Company Executive Officer, Battalion Operations Officer and Commander of
      an Air Cavalry Troop in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry.  He was later assigned to
      the Aviation Directorate of Combat Developments as an Advanced Weapons
      Research and Development Engineer.  He earned a Master of Science degree
      in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1992 with research in the
      areas of hypersonic and high-temperature gas dynamics, flight stability
      &amp; control and robotics.  He is a graduate of Class 104 from the U.S.
      Naval Test Pilot School and was subsequently assigned as an Experimental
      Test Pilot with the Army Aviation Technical Test Center (ATTC).  His
      flight testing was focused in the areas of tactical reconnaissance and
      surveillance systems in a variety of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft.  He
      served as Division Chief for testing of Army Scout/Attack aircraft and
      weapons systems in support of tactical operations in the Balkans.  Colonel
      Wheelock’s work as a test pilot culminated in his assignment as Division
      Chief for fixed-wing testing of airborne signal and imagery intelligence
      systems in support of the National Program Office for Intelligence and
      Electronic Warfare.  He completed his military career as the Commander of
      the U.S. Army Space &amp; Missile Defense Command - NASA Detachment. 
      Colonel Wheelock is a veteran of three combat tours and 38 combat missions
      in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  He is also a graduate of the
      Army Airborne and Air Assault Courses, the Infantry and Aviation Officer
      Advanced Courses, the Combined Arms Services Staff School, the Material
      Acquisition Management Course and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff
      College.</p>
    <p>Colonel Wheelock is a dual-rated Master Army Aviator and has logged more
      than 7,000 flight hours in 46 different rotary and fixed-wing aircraft and
      spacecraft.  He is also an FAA-rated commercial pilot in single- and
      multi-engine land craft, rotorcraft and gliders.</p>
    <p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Colonel Wheelock reported for
      Astronaut Candidate Training in August 1998.  He was assigned to the
      Astronaut Office International Space Station Operations Branch as a
      Russian Liaison, participating in the testing and integration of Russian
      hardware and software products developed for the station.  He worked
      extensively with the Energia Aerospace Company in Moscow, Russia, and has
      led joint U.S./Russian teams to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to
      oversee bench reviews, inventory, loading and launch of the first four
      unmanned International Space Station (ISS) resupply capsules.</p>
    <p>In 2001, Colonel Wheelock assumed duties as the Crew Support Astronaut
      for the International Space Station Expedition 2 and Expedition 4 crews. 
      He was the primary contact for all crew needs, coordination, planning and
      interactions and was the primary representative of the crews while they
      were on orbit.  In August 2002, Colonel Wheelock was assigned as a Capsule
      Communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center in Houston.  In this
      role, he was the primary communication link between crews on orbit and the
      ground support team in the Mission Control Center.  He was the lead CAPCOM
      for ISS Expedition 8.</p>
    <p>In January 2005, Colonel Wheelock was assigned to the Gagarin Cosmonaut
      Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, Russia, as NASA’s Director of
      Operations - Russia.  He was responsible for supporting Russian-based
      training, logistics and administrative needs of NASA astronauts preparing
      for flight on the International Space Station.  Colonel Wheelock was the
      primary liaison between Star City and NASA operations in Houston,
      including medical, training, science, contracting, public affairs and
      administration departments.  He was also responsible for liaison duties
      between NASA and the Russian Space Agency as well as the Russian aerospace
      industry. </p>
    <p>Colonel Wheelock completed training in the NASA Extreme Environments
      Mission Operations (NEEMO) program, during a 10-day undersea mission
      aboard the National Undersea Research Center’s <em>Aquarius</em>
      habitat.  Colonel Wheelock has flown aboard the space shuttle, the
      International Space Station and the Russian Soyuz TMA spacecraft.  He has
      accumulated more than 178 days in space and has conducted six spacewalks
      totaling 43 hours and 30 minutes.  His experience outside of the station
      includes four contingency spacewalks to repair a torn solar array and
      replace a failed ammonia pump module.</p>
    <p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-120 <em>Discovery</em>
      (October 23 to November 7, 2007) launched from and returned to land at
      Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  During the mission, the Node 2 module, <em>Harmony</em>,
      was delivered to the International Space Station.  This element opened up
      the capability for future international laboratories to be added to the
      station.  Wheelock accumulated 20 hours and 41 minutes of EVA during three
      spacewalks.  One of the major EVA mission objectives was the relocation of
      the P6 Solar Array from the top of the Z1 Truss to the end of the port
      side of the Integrated Truss Structure.  During the redeploy of the solar
      array, several array panels snagged and were damaged, requiring an
      unplanned spacewalk to successfully repair the array.  The American
      Astronautical Society’s Flight Achievement Award was presented to the
      spacewalkers for demonstrating the importance of ingenuity and heroism in
      exploring space.  The mission was accomplished in 238 orbits, traveling
      6.2 million miles in 15 days, 2 hours and 23 minutes.</p>
    <p>Soyuz TMA 23S <em>Olympus</em>/International Space Station Expedition
      24/25 (June 15 to November 25, 2010) - Colonel Wheelock launched from the
      Baikonur Cosmodrome as a Flight Engineer on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft
      for a 2-day autonomous flight to the station.  He began his long-duration
      stay aboard the orbiting outpost as a Flight Engineer for Expedition 24
      and then assumed command of the station and the Expedition 25 crew.
       During Expedition 25, there were more than 120 microgravity experiments
      in human research, biology and biotechnology, physical and materials
      sciences, technology development and Earth and space sciences.  Colonel
      Wheelock also responded to an emergency shutdown of half of the station’s
      external cooling system and was the lead spacewalker for three unplanned
      EVAs to replace the faulty ammonia pump module that caused the shutdown.
      His efforts restored the station’s critical cooling system to full
      function.  For his actions during this challenging time, Colonel Wheelock
      was presented the American Red Cross 2010 <em>Hero in Space</em> Award,
      and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale 2010 <em>Yuri Gagarin Gold
        Medal</em> Award.  The mission duration was 163 days and culminated in a
      parachute landing in the <em>Olympus</em> capsule in Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p>To date, Colonel Wheelock has accumulated more than 178 days in space.</p>
