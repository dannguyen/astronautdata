<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Gordon, a Navy Captain, received his wings 
  as a naval aviator in 1953. He then attended All-Weather Flight School and jet 
  transitional training and was subsequently assigned to an all-weather fighter 
  squadron at the Naval Air Station at Jacksonville, Florida.</p>

<p>In 1957, he attended the Navy's Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland, 
  and served as a flight test pilot until 1960. During this tour of duty, he did 
  flight test work on the F8U Crusader, F11F Tigercat, FJ Fury, and A4D Skyhawk, 
  and was the first project test pilot for the F4H Phantom II. He served with 
  Fighter Squadron 121 at the Miramar, California, Naval Air Station as a flight 
  instructor in the F4H and participated in the introduction of that aircraft 
  to the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. He was also flight safety officer, assistant 
  operations officer, and ground training officer for Fighter Squadron 96 at Miramar.</p>

<p>Winner of the Bendix Trophy Race from Los Angeles to New York in May 1961, he 
  established a new speed record of 869.74 miles per hour and a transcontinental 
  speed record of 2 hours and 47 minutes.</p>

<p>He was also a student at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California.</p>

<p>He has logged more that 4,500 hours flying time--3,500 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Captain Gordon was one of the third 
  group of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. He served as backup pilot 
  for the Gemini 8 flight.</p>

<p>On September 12, 1966, he served as pilot for the 3-day Gemini XI mission--on 
  which rendezvous with an Agena was achieved in less than one orbit. He executed 
  docking maneuvers with the previously launched Agena and performed two periods 
  of extravehicular activity which included attaching a tether to the Agena and 
  retrieving a nuclear emulsion experiment package. Other highlights accomplished 
  by Gordon and command pilot Charles Conrad on this flight included the successful 
  completion of the first tethered station-keeping exercise, establishment of 
  a new altitude record of 850 miles, and completion of the first fully automatic 
  controlled reentry. The flight was concluded on September 15, 1966, with the 
  spacecraft landing in the Atlantic--2 1/2 miles from the prime recovery ship 
  USS GUAM.</p>

<p>Gordon was subsequently assigned as backup command pilot for Apollo 9.</p>

<p>He occupied the command module pilot seat on Apollo 12, November 14-24, 1969. 
  Other crewmen on man's second lunar landing mission were Charles Conrad, spacecraft 
  commander, and Alan L. Bean, lunar module pilot. Throughout the 31-hour lunar 
  surface stay by Conrad and Bean, Gordon remained in lunar orbit aboard the command 
  module, &quot;Yankee Clipper,&quot; obtaining desired mapping photographs of 
  tentative landing sites for future missions. He also performed the final re-docking 
  maneuvers following the successful lunar orbit rendezvous which was initiated 
  by Conrad and Bean from within &quot;Intrepid&quot; after their ascent from 
  the moon's surface.</p>

<p>All of the mission's objectives were accomplished and Apollo 12 achievements 
  include: The first precision lunar landing with &quot;Intrepid's&quot; touchdown 
  in the moon's Ocean of Storms; the first lunar traverse by Conrad and Bean as 
  they deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP), installed 
  a nuclear power generator station to provide the power source for these long-term 
  scientific experiments, gathered samples of the lunar surface for return to 
  earth, and completed a close up inspection of the Surveyor III spacecraft.</p>

<p>The Apollo 12 mission lasted 244 hours and 36 minutes and was concluded with 
  a Pacific spashdown and subsequent recovery operations by the USS HORNET.</p>

<p>Captain Gordon has completed two space flights, logging a total of 315 hours 
  and 53 minutes in space--2 hours and 44 minutes of which were spent in EVA.</p>

<p>He served as backup spacecraft commander for Apollo 15.</p>

<p>Captain Gordon retired from NASA and the USN in January 1972.</p>

<p>Since then he has served as Executive Vice President of the New Orleans Saints 
  Professional Football Club in the National Football League (1972); was General 
  Manager of Energy Developers, Limited (EDL), a Texas Partnership involved in 
  a joint venture with Rocket Research Corporation for the development of a liquid 
  chemical explosive for use in the oil and gas industry (1977); President of 
  Resolution Engineering and Development Company (REDCO) which provided design 
  and operational requirements for wild oil well control and fire fighting equipment 
  onboard large semi-submersible utility vessels (1978); following REDCO merger 
  with Amarco Resources, Gordon assumed the additional duties of Vice President 
  of Marketing, Westdale, an oil well servicing subsidiary of AMARCO operating 
  in North Central Texas and Oklahoma, and also served as Vice President for Operations, 
  Texas Division (1980); served as Director, Scott Science and Technology, Inc., 
  Los Angeles Division (1981-1983). In March 1982 he became President of Astro 
  Sciences Corporation. This company provides a range of services including engineering, 
  project management, project field support teams, to software and hardware system 
  design for control room applications. In the Summer of 1984, Gordon was a Technical 
  Advisor for and played the part of &quot;Capcom&quot; in the CBS mini-series 
  'Space' by James A. Michener.</p>
