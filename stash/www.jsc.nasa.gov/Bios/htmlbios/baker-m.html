<p><strong>SPECIAL  HONORS:</strong>  Awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, 2  Defense Meritorious Service Medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Legion  of Merit, the Navy Unit Commendation, 3 Meritorious Unit Commendations, the  Battle &quot;E&quot; Award, NASA Distinguished Service Medal, NASA Outstanding  Leadership Medal, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, 4 NASA Space Flight Medals, 3  Navy Expeditionary Medals, the National Defense Medal, 2 Sea Service Awards,  and the Overseas Service Award.  Named  1993 Outstanding University of Texas Alumni.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  After graduation from the University of  Texas, Baker completed flight training and earned his Wings of Gold at Naval  Air Station Chase Field, Beeville, Texas, in 1977.  In 1978, he was assigned to Attack Squadron  56, embarked in the <em>USS Midway</em>,  homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, where he flew the A-7E Corsair II.  In late 1980 he was assigned to Carrier Air  Wing 30 as the air wing landing signal officer.   He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1981 and, after  graduation, was assigned to the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Strike  Aircraft Test Directorate.  While there,  Baker conducted carrier suitability structural tests, aircraft carrier catapult  and arresting gear certification tests, and automatic carrier landing system  certification and verification tests on the various aircraft carriers of the  Navy&rsquo;s fleet in the A-7 aircraft.  In  1983, he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor.  He was then assigned as the U.S. Navy  exchange instructor at the Empire Test Pilots School in Boscombe Down, England,  teaching performance, flying qualities and systems flight test techniques.</p>
<p>He has logged over 5,400 hours flying  time in approximately 50 different types of airplanes, including tactical jets,  VSTOL, multi-engine transport and rotary wing aircraft, and has over 300  carrier landings to his credit.</p>
<p><strong>NASA  EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Selected by NASA in June 1985, Baker became  an astronaut in July 1986 upon completion of a one-year training and evaluation  program.  </p>
<p>Following the Challenger accident, from  January 1986 to December 1987, Baker was assigned as a member of the team that  was pursuing redesign, modification and improvements to the Shuttle Landing and  Deceleration Systems, including nosewheel steering, brakes, tires, and drag  chute, in an effort to provide greater safety margins during landing and  rollout.  He was then assigned to the  Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), where he was involved in the  checkout and verification of the computer software and hardware interfaces for STS-26 (the return-to-flight mission) and  subsequent flights.</p>
<p>Baker then  served as an ascent, entry and orbit spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-27, STS-29,  STS-30, STS-28,  STS-34, STS-33,  STS-32, STS-36,  STS-31, STS-38,  and STS-35.  In this capacity his duties included  communication with the Shuttle crew during simulations and actual missions, as  well as working procedural problems and modifications between missions.  He served as the leader of the Astronaut  Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center for Shuttle Missions STS-44, STS-42  and STS-45.  From December 1992 to January 1994 he was  assigned as the Flight Crew Operations Directorate Representative to the Space  Shuttle Program Office.  From March to  October 1995 he served as the Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin  Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia.   He was responsible for the coordination and implementation of mission  operation activities in the Moscow region for the joint U.S./Russian  Shuttle/Mir program.</p>
<p>From October  1997 to August 2001 he was the Assistant Director of Johnson Space Center (JSC)  for Human Space Flight Programs, Russia and was responsible for implementation  and integration of NASA&rsquo;s Human space flight programs in Russia. Those  activities included International Space Station (ISS) training, operations,  technical liaison, logistics and personnel administration support.  He also served as the NASA JSC representative  to the Russian Space Agency, Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City;  Mission Control Center-Moscow, Energia Rocket and Spacecraft Corporation,  Krunichev State Scientific and Production Space Center and other Russian  government agencies and manufacturers involved in the ISS program.  </p>
<p>A veteran of  four space flights, Baker has logged 965 hours in space.  He served as pilot on STS-43  (August 2-11, 1991) and STS-52  (October 22 to November   1, 1992), and was the mission commander on STS-68  (September 30 to October   11, 1994) and STS-81  (January 12-22, 1997).</p>
<p>Mike Baker is  currently assigned as the International Space Station Program Manager for  International and Crew Operations and is responsible for the coordination of  program operations, integration and flight crew training and support activities  with the International Partners.</p>
<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-43 space shuttle Atlantislaunched from NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy  Space Center, Florida, on August 2, 1991.   During the flight, crew members deployed the fifth Tracking and Data  Relay Satellite (TDRS-E), in addition to conducting 32 physical, material, and  life science experiments, mostly relating to the Extended Duration Orbiter and  Space Station Freedom.  After 142 Earth  orbits, the 9-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy  Space Center on August   11, 1991.  Mission duration  was 213 hours, 21 minutes, 25 seconds. </p>
<p>STS-52 space shuttle  Columbialaunched from  the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 22, 1992.  During the mission crew members deployed the  Italian Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS) that will be used to measure  movement of the Earth&rsquo;s crust, and operated the U.S. Microgravity Payload 1  (USMP-1).  Additionally, the Space Vision  System (SVS) developed by the Canadian Space Agency was tested by the Canadian  payload specialist and the crew using a small target assembly that was released  from the remote manipulator system.  The  SVS will be used for Space Station construction.  These three primary payloads together with  numerous other payloads operated by the crew encompassed geophysics, materials  science, biological research and applied research for Space Station  Freedom.  Following 159 Earth orbits, the  10-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space  Center on November   1, 1992.  Mission duration  was 236 hours, 56 minutes, 13 seconds.  </p>
<p>STS-68 space shuttle  Endeavour launched from the  Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994.  This flight was the second flight of the  Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) comprised of a large radar called SIR-C/X-SAR  (Shuttle Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from  Satellites).  As part of NASA&rsquo;s Mission  to Planet Earth, SRL was an international, multidisciplinary study of global  environmental change, both natural and man-made.  The primary objective was to radar map the  surface of the Earth to help us understand the contributions of ecology,  hydrology, geology, and oceanography to changes in our Planet&rsquo;s  environment.  Real-time crew observations  of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs, aided in  interpretation of the radar images. This SRL mission was a highly successful  test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological  monitoring of planet Earth.  Following  183 Earth orbits, the eleven-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 22  at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 11, 1994.  Mission duration was 269 hours, 46 minutes,  10 seconds.</p>
<p>STS-81 space shuttle  Atlantis launched from the  Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 12, 1997.  STS-81  was the fifth in a series of joint missions between the U.S. space shuttle and  the Russian Space Station <em>Mir</em> and the second one involving an exchange  of U.S. astronauts.  In five days of docked  operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and  samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft.  Following 160 Earth orbits the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy  Space Center&rsquo;s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey.  Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes. </p>
