<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Cernan, a retired United States Navy Captain, 
  received his commission through the Navy ROTC Program at Purdue. He entered 
  flight training upon graduation. He was assigned to Attack Squadrons 26 and 
  112 at the Miramar, California, Naval Air Station, and Subsequently attended 
  the Naval Postgraduate School. He has logged more than 5000 hours flying time 
  with more than 4800 hours in jet aircraft and over 200 jet aircraft carrier 
  landings.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Captain Cernan was one of fourteen astronauts 
  selected by NASA in October 1963.</p>

<p>He occupied the pilot seat alongside of command pilot Tom Stafford on the Gemini 
  IX mission. During this 3-day flight which Began on June 3, 1966, the spacecraft 
  achieved a circular orbit of 161 statute miles; the crew used three different 
  techniques to effect rendezvous with the previously launched Augmented Target 
  Docking Adapter; and Cernan, the second American to walk in space, logged two 
  hours and ten minutes outside the spacecraft in extravehicular activities. The 
  flight ended after 72 hours and 20 minutes with a perfect re-entry and recovery 
  as Gemini IX landed within 1-1/2 miles of the prime recovery ship USS WASP and 
  3/8 of a mile from the predetermined target.</p>

<p>Cernan subsequently served as backup pilot for Gemini 12 and as backup lunar 
  module pilot for Apollo 7.</p>

<p>On his second space flight, he was lunar module pilot of Apollo 10, May 18-26, 
  1969, the first comprehensive lunar-orbital qualification and verification flight 
  test of an Apollo lunar module. He was accompanied on the 248,000 nautical sojourn 
  to the moon by Thomas P. Stafford (spacecraft commander) and John W. Young (commander 
  module pilot). In accomplishing all of the assigned objectives of this mission, 
  Apollo 10 confirmed the operations performance, stability, and reliability of 
  the command/service module and lunar module configuration during trans-lunar 
  coast, lunar orbit insertion, and lunar module separation and descent to within 
  8 nautical miles of the lunar surface. The latter maneuver involved employing 
  all but the final minutes of the technique prescribed for use in an actual lunar 
  landing, and allowed critical evaluations of the lunar module propulsions systems 
  and rendezvous of the landing radar devices in subsequent rendezvous and re-docking 
  maneuvers. In addition to demonstrating that man could navigate safely and accurately 
  in the moon's gravitational fields, Apollo 10 photographed and mapped tentative 
  landing sites for future missions.</p>

<p>Cernan's next assignment was backup spacecraft commander for Apollo 14.</p>

<p>He made his third space flight as spacecraft commander of Apollo 17--the last 
  scheduled manned mission to the moon for the United States--which commenced 
  at 11:33 P.M. (CST), December 6, 1972, with the first manned nighttime launch, 
  and concluded on December 19, 1972. With him on the voyage of the command module 
  &quot;America&quot; and the lunar module &quot;<i>Challenger</i>&quot; were 
  Ronald Evans (command module pilot) and Harrison H. (Jack) Schmitt (lunar module 
  pilot). In maneuvering &quot;<i>Challenger</i>&quot; to a landing at Taurus-Littrow, 
  located on the southeast edge of Mare Serenitatis, Cernan and Schmitt activated 
  a base of operations from which they completed three highly successful excursions 
  to the nearby craters and the Taurus mountains, making the Moon their home for 
  over three days. This last mission to the moon established several new records 
  for manned space flight that include: longest manned lunar landing flight (301 
  hours 51 minutes); longest lunar surface extravehicular activities (22 hours 
  6 minutes); largest lunar sample return (an estimated 115 kg (249 lbs.); and 
  longest time in lunar orbit (147 hours 48 minutes). While Cernan and Schmitt 
  conducted activities on the lunar surface, Evans remained in lunar orbit aboard 
  the &quot;America&quot; completing assigned work tasks requiring geological 
  observations, handheld photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras 
  and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the command module 
  SIM-bay. Evans also completed a 1-hour, 6-minute extravehicular activity on 
  the transearth coast phase of the return flight, successfully retrieving three 
  camera cassettes and completing a personal inspection of the equipment bay area. 
  Apollo 17 ended with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean approximately 0.4 miles 
  from the target point and 4.3 miles form the prime recovery ship USS TICONDEROGA.</p>

<p>Captain Cernan has logged 566 hours and 15 minutes in space-of which more than 
  73 hours were spent on the surface of the moon.</p>

<p>In September, 1973, Cernan assumed additional duties as Special Assistant to 
  the Program Manager of the Apollo spacecraft Program at the Johnson Space Center. 
  In this capacity, he assisted in the planning, development, and evaluation of 
  the joint United States/Soviet Union Apollo-Soyuz mission, and he acted for 
  the program manager as the senior United States negotiator in direct discussions 
  with the USSR on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1976, Captain Cernan retired after over 20 years with the U.S. Navy. 
  He concurrently terminated his formal association with NASA.</p>

<p>Captain Cernan was the second American to have walked in space having spanned 
  the circumference of the world twice in a little more than 2-1/2 hours. He was 
  one of the two men to have flown to the moon on two occasions, and as commander 
  of the last mission to the moon, Apollo 17, had the privilege and distinction 
  of being the last man to have left his footprints on the surface of the moon.</p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS:</strong> Cernan joined Coral Petroleum, Inc., of Houston, 
  Texas, as Executive Vice President-International. His responsibilities were 
  to enhance Coral's energy related programs on a worldwide basis</p>

<p>In September 1981, Captain Cernan started his own company, The Cernan Corporation, 
  to pursue management and consultant interests in the energy, aerospace, and 
  other related industries. Additionally he has been actively involved as a co-anchorman 
  on ABC-TV's presentations of the flight of the shuttle.</p>

<p>In a recent acquisition, Captain Cernan became Chairman of the Board of Johnson 
  Engineering Corporation. Johnson Engineering currently provides the National 
  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with Flight Crew Systems Development 
  with personnel located both on and off site at Johnson Space Center. Over the 
  last seventeen years, Johnson Engineering has supported NASA in the design of 
  crew stations for Space Shuttle, Spacelab, Space Station, Lunar Base and Mars 
  Outpost. The company is directly involved with the operation of the 1-G trainers 
  in Building 9A and B, as well as the Weightless Environment Training Facility 
  in Building 29.</p>
