      shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological training,
      T-38 flight training, and water and wilderness survival training.  Bresnik
      completed his first spaceflight on STS-129 in November 2009.  In 2010,
      Bresnik trained as a cave-a-naut in the extreme environment training of 
      the European Space Agency’s Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and
      Exercising human behavior and performance Skills (CAVES), in Sardina,
      Italy.  This was the first spaceflight analog of its type living deep
      beneath the surface of the Earth.   </p>
    <p>In September 2014, Bresnik, his three crew members and two habitat
      technicians tested technologies and training techniques for use aboard the
      International Space Station and future deep space exploration missions
      during NASA’s Extreme Environment Mission Operation (NEEMO 19). Bresnik
      was the Commander of NEEMO 19 team of aquanauts. The mission was conducted
      in Florida International University’s undersea research habitat the
      Aquarius Reef Base, located six miles off the coast of Key Largo, Florida,
      and 62 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. </p>
    <p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-129 (November 16 through
      November 29, 2009) was the 31st shuttle flight to the International Space
      Station.  During the mission, the crew delivered two Express Logistics
      Carriers (ELC racks) to the space station, approximately 30,000 pounds of
      replacement parts for systems that provide power to the station to keep it
      from overheating, and maintain proper orientation in space.  Bresnik
      performed two spacewalks for a total of 11 hours and 50 minutes.  The
      STS-129 mission was completed in 10 days, 19 hours, 16 minutes and 13
      seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 171 orbits, and returned to Earth
      bringing back with them NASA astronaut Nicole Stott following her tour of
      duty aboard the station.</p>
