    Unit Commendations, two Navy Battle Efficiency Awards, the Sea Service Deployment 
    Ribbon, and seven NASA Group Achievement Awards.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Thuot graduated 30th in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1977 and 
    commenced Naval Flight Officer training in July 1977. He received his wings 
    in August 1978 and then reported to Fighter Squadron 101 at NAS Oceana, Virginia 
    Beach, Virginia, for initial F-14 Tomcat training as a Radar Intercept Officer 
    (RIO). Upon completion of this training he was assigned to Fighter Squadron 
    14 and made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas aboard 
    the USS John F. Kennedy and USS Independence. While assigned to Fighter Squadron 
    14 he attended the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). He was then selected 
    to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in May 1982. Upon graduation in 
    June 1983 he worked as a project test flight officer at the Naval Air Test 
    Center flying the F-14A Tomcat, A-6E Intruder and the F-4J Phantom II until 
    June 1984 when he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as a flight 
    instructor.</p>

<p>He has over 3,500 flight hours in more than 40 different aircraft, and 
      has over 270 carrier landings.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1985, Thuot has served in a variety 
    of technical assignments. As the Remote Manipulator System (robot arm), crew 
    equipment, and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) representative for the Astronaut 
    Office, he participated in the design, development, and evaluation of Space 
    Shuttle payloads, crew equipment, and crew procedures. He performed Space 
    Shuttle flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory 
    and served as a CAPCOM in the Mission Control Center, responsible for communications 
    with the crew for numerous Space Shuttle missions. He served as the lead astronaut 
    for Space Station integrated assembly and maintenance operations within the 
    Astronaut Office. He served as Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Support 
    Branch, as well as supervising Astronaut Candidate training for the Class 
    of 1995. A veteran of three space flights, STS-36 in 1990, STS-49 in 1992, 
    and STS-62 in 1994, Thuot has logged over 654 hours in space, including 17.7 
    hours on three space walks.</p>

<p>On his first flight, Thuot was a mission specialist on the crew of STS-36 
      which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990, 
      aboard the Space Shuttle <i>Atlantis</i>. This mission carried Department 
      of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. Following 72 orbits 
      of the Earth in 106 hours, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing 
      at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990, after traveling 
      1.87 million miles.</p>

<p>Thuot was a mission specialist on the crew of STS-49, the maiden voyage 
      of the Space Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i>, which launched from the Kennedy Space 
      Center on May 7, 1992. During that mission, Thuot, along with astronaut 
      Rick Hieb, performed three space walks which resulted in the capture and 
      repair of the stranded Intelsat VI F3 communications satellite. The third 
      space walk, which also included astronaut Tom Akers, was the first ever 
      three-person space walk. This 8 hour and 29 minute space walk, the longest 
      in history, broke a twenty year old record that was held by Apollo 17 astronauts. 
      The mission concluded on May 16, 1992 with a landing at Edwards Air Force 
      Base after orbiting the Earth 141 times in 213 hours and traveling 3.7 million 
      miles.</p>

<p>On March 4, 1994, Thuot launched aboard <i>Columbia</i> on STS-62, a microgravity 
      science and technology demonstration mission which carried the United States 
      Microgravity Payload (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology 
      (OAST-2) payloads. More than sixty experiments or investigations were conducted 
      in many scientific and engineering disciplines including materials science, 
      human physiology, biotechnology, protein crystal growth, robotics, structural 
      dynamics, atmospheric ozone monitoring, and spacecraft glow. During the 
      spacecraft glow investigation, <i>Columbia</i>'s orbital altitude was lowered 
      to 105 nautical miles, the lowest ever flown by a Space Shuttle. STS-62, 
      one of the longest Space Shuttle missions, concluded on March 18, 1994 with 
      a landing at the Kennedy Space Center after orbiting the Earth 224 times 
      in 13 days, 23 hours, and 16 minutes and traveling 5.8 million miles.</p>

<p>With the completion of his third mission, Thuot has logged over 654 hours 
      in space, including over 17.7 hours on three space walks.</p>

<p>Thuot left NASA in June 1995, and returned to the Navy. He is an Associate 
      Chairman in the Aerospace Engineering Department, United States Naval Academy, 
      Annapolis, Maryland.</p>
