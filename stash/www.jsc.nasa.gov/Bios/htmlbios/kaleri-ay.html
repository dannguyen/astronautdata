<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>&nbsp; After graduating from the Institute he worked at the Russian Space Corporation Energia from September, 1979 until April 1984 as an engineer researching aerodynamic loads.&nbsp; He participated in the “Astra” experiment for the Salyut-7 space station.&nbsp; Studied aerodynamics of the Energia launch vehicle first stage launchers from separation to parachuting.&nbsp; Participated in developing design and technical documentation of the Mir orbital station.&nbsp; He has logged 22 flight hours piloting the L-39 training aircraft.&nbsp; Performed 14 parachute jumps.</p>
<p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT TRAINING:</strong>&nbsp; In April 1984, he was qualified as an RSC Energia cosmonaut candidate.&nbsp; From November 1985 to October 1986, Kaleri completed basic space training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.&nbsp; After successfully passing the exams, he received qualification of a test-cosmonaut.</p>
<p> From April 1987 to May 1991, Kaleri trained as a Soyuz TM flight engineer on Mir-3, 8 and 9 backup crews.&nbsp; From May to July 1991 Kaleri trained as the flight engineer of Soyuz TM-13 mission for Expedition -10/Astromir on the Mir station.</p>
<p>From October 1991 to March 1992, he trained as a prime flight engineer for the Soyuz TM-14 crew for the Mir-11 mission.&nbsp; From September 1995 to August 1996 he trained as a back flight engineer on the Soyuz TM-24 (Mir-22/NASA-3) mission.&nbsp; A few days prior to the mission the backup crew was assigned as the prime crew for the mission.</p>
<p>From December 1997 to July 1998, Kaleri trained as a backup flight engineer on the Mir-26 mission.&nbsp; From March 1999 to March 2000 he trained as a flight engineer on the Mir-28 prime mission.</p>
<p> From January 2001 to May 2002, Kaleri trained as a backup commander on ISS-5.&nbsp; From September 2002 to February 2003 he trained as an ISS-7 backup engineer for a shuttle launch.</p>
<p>From February to April 2003, Kaleri trained as an ISS-7 backup engineer, as Soyuz TMA commander, and ISS flight engineer.&nbsp; From June to October 2003 he trained for the ISS-8 mission as Soyuz-TMA-3 commander and ISS flight engineer.</p>
<p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>&nbsp; Kaleri performed his first spaceflight from March 17 to August 10, 1992 as Soyuz TM-14 flight engineer and Mir flight engineer of the Mir-11 prime mission, Russian-German Mir-92 mission and Russian-French “Antares” program.&nbsp; During the flight the crew performed ecological filming per the UN program, technological experiments on monocrystal growth of different composition as well as operations in the “X-ray” observatory. &nbsp;Kaleri performed one EVA that lasted 2 hours and 3 minutes.&nbsp; The mission duration was 145 days.</p>
<p>Kaleri performed his second spaceflight from August 17, 1996 to March 2, 1997 on the Soyuz TM-24 vehicle and the Mir station as the Mir-22 flight engineer, Russian-American “Mir-22/NASA-3” and Russian-French “Cassiopeia” program.&nbsp; During this mission an autonomous flight of the cargo vehicle was performed for the first time with follow-up return to the station.&nbsp; Besides, the work of the Expedition 22 crew was really sensational– wheat spikes appeared in the Svet greenhouse for the first time.&nbsp; Kaleri logged over 12 hours and 36 minutes of EVA in 2 spacewalks and another 197 days in space.</p>
<p>On his third space mission from April 3 to June 16, 2000, Kaleri participated as Mir-28 flight engineer.&nbsp; During the experiments “Plasma Crystal-2” the crew managed to get consistent organized spatial structures for the first time in weightlessness.&nbsp; Mir-28 was the last Mir mission. &nbsp;Kaleri logged 5 EVA hours in one spacewalk.&nbsp; The mission duration was 73 days.</p>
<p>On his fourth spaceflight on ISS Expedition 8 from October 18, 2003 to April 30, 2004, Kaleri served as Flight Engineer aboard the International Space Station. &nbsp;Mission duration was 195 days and included one EVA of 3 hours and 56 minute duration.</p>
