  Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington prior to his selection as 
  an astronaut. He was a staff physicist at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory at 
  Yale University in 1965 and 1966, and during the period 1963 to 1967, served 
  as a guest research associate at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 3,000 hours flying time in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Allen was selected as a scientist-astronaut 
  by NASA in August 1967. He completed flight training at Vance Air Force Base, 
  Oklahoma. He served as mission scientist while a member of the astronaut support 
  crew for Apollo 15 and served as a staff consultant on science and technology 
  to the President's Council on International Economic Policy.</p>

<p>From August 1975 to 1978, Dr. Allen served as NASA Assistant Administrator for 
  Legislative Affairs in Washington, D.C. Returning to the Johnson Space Center 
  in 1978, as a senior scientist astronaut, Dr. Allen was assigned to the Operations 
  Mission Development Group. He served as a support crew member for the first 
  orbital flight test of the Space Transportation System and was the entry CAPCOM 
  for this mission. In addition, in 1980 and 1981, he worked as the technical 
  assistant to the director of flight operations. He was a mission specialist 
  on STS-5 (November 11-16, 1982) and STS-51A (November 8-16,1984) and has logged

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-5 was the first fully operational 
  flight of the Shuttle Transportation System, which launched from Kennedy Space 
  Center, Florida, on November 11, 1982. The crew aboard <i>Columbia</i> included 
  Vance D. Brand (spacecraft commander), Col. Robert F. Overmyer (pilot), and 
  Dr. William B. Lenoir (mission specialist). STS-5, the first mission with a 
  crew of four, clearly demonstrated the Space Shuttle as fully operational by 
  the successful first deployment of two commercial communications satellites 
  from the Orbiter's payload bay. The mission also marked the first use of the 
  Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), and its new ejection system. Numerous flight 
  tests were performed throughout the mission to document Shuttle performance 
  during launch, boost, orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases. STS-5 was 
  the last flight to carry the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package 
  to support flight testing. A Getaway Special, three Student Involvement Projects, 
  and medical experiments were included on the mission. The crew successfully 
  concluded the 5-day orbital flight of <i>Columbia</i> with the first entry and 
  landing through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway and demonstrated maximum 
  braking. STS-5 completed 81 orbits of the Earth in 122 hours before landing 
  on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 16, 
  1982.</p>

<p>STS-51A <i>Discovery</i> , which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 
  on November 8, 1984. The crew aboard <i>Discovery</i> included Captain Frederick 
  (Rick) Hauck (spacecraft commander), Captain David M. Walker (pilot), and fellow 
  mission specialists, Dr. Anna L. Fisher and Commander Dale H. Gardner. This 
  was the second flight of Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i>. During the mission 
  the crew deployed two satellites, Canada's Anik D-2 (Telsat H) and Hughes' LEASAT-1 
  (Syncome IV-1), and operated the 3M Company's Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions 
  experiment. In the first space salvage attempt in history the crew successfully 
  retrieved for return to Earth the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI communications satellites. 
  STS-51A completed 127 orbits of the Earth in 192 hours before landing at Kennedy 
  Space Center, Florida, on November 16, 1984.</p>
