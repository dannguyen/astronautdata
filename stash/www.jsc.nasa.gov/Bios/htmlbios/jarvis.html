<p><strong>AWARDS:</strong> Posthumously awarded the Congressional Space 
  Medal of Honor.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Mohawk Central High School, 
  Mohawk, New York, 1962; received a bachelor of science degree in electrical 
  engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, 1967; a masters degree 
  in electrical engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, 1969. 
  Mr. Jarvis also completed all of the course work for a masters degree in management 
  science, West Coast University, Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> While pursuing his masters degree at Northeastern, 
  Mr. Jarvis worked at Raytheon in Bedford Massachusetts, where he was involved 
  in circuit design on the SAM-D missile. In July 1969, he entered active duty 
  in the Air Force and was assigned to the Space Division in El Segundo, California. 
  As a Communications Payload Engineer, in the Satellite Communications Program 
  Office, he worked on advanced tactical communications satellites. He was involved 
  in the concept formulation, source selection, and early design phase of the 
  FLTSATCOM communications payload. After being honorably discharged from the 
  Air Force in 1973, with the rank of Captain, he joined Hughes Aircraft Companys 
  Space and Communications group, where he worked as a Communications Subsystem 
  Engineer on the MARISAT Program. In 1975, he became the MARISAT F-3 Spacecraft 
  Test and Integration Manager. In 1976, the MARISAT F-3 was placed in geosynchronous 
  orbit. Jarvis became a member of the Systems Applications Laboratory in 1976, 
  and was involved in the concept definition for advanced UHF and SHF communications 
  for the strategic forces. Joining the Advanced Program Laboratory in 1978, he 
  began working on the concept formulation and subsequent proposal for the SYNCON 
  IV/LEASAT Program. In 1979, he became the Power/Thermal/Harness Subsystem Engineer 
  on the LEASAT Program. In 1981, he became the Spacecraft Bus System Engineering

  in 1983, where he worked until the shipment of the F-1 spacecraft and cradle 
  to Cape Kennedy for integration into the Orbiter. Both the F-1 and F-2 LEASAT 
  spacecraft have successfully achieved their geosynchronous positions. Mr. Jarvis 
  worked on advanced satellite designs in the Systems Application Laboratory. 
  He was selected as a payload specialist candidate in July 1984.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Mr. Jarvis was a payload specialist 
  on STS 51-L which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 11:38:00 
  EST on January 28, 1986. The crew on board the Orbiter <i>Challenger</i> included 
  the spacecraft commander, Mr. F.R. Scobee, the pilot, Commander M.J. Smith (USN), 
  mission specialists, Dr. R.E. McNair, Lieutenant Colonel E.S. Onizuka (USAF), 
  and Dr. J. A. Resnik, and fellow civilian payload specialist, Mrs. S. C. McAuliffe.
