  open water dives and photographic exhibitions. Dr. Furrer died in an airplane 
  accident on September 9, 1995.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong>: Realgymnasium at Kempten, Allgau. Studied 
  physics at the Universities of Kiel and Berlin. Received a diploma in physics 
  in 1969, and a doctor of philosophy degree in physics in 1972.</p>

<p><strong>PROFESSION:</strong> University Teacher, Free University Berlin; 
  and Scientist Astronaut at the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DFVLR).</p>

  <li>1983, Scientist Astronaut of the German Spacelab Mission &quot;D-1&quot;.</li>
  <li>Practical research in the following fields: Atomic physics (highly ionized noble gasses), solid-state physics (single crystals of inorganic and organic materials), chemical physics and photophysics (solid-state photoreactions, photosynthesis), and biophysics (structural analysis of enzymes)</li>
  <li>Applied experimental methods: Optical spectroscopy, laser spectroscopy, HF-spectroscopy, Optically detected magnetic resonances, electron-spin-echoes, and transient electron spin mutations.</li>
  <li>Teaching experience: Lectured in experimental physics and supervised undergraduate and graduate students. Public lecture series &quot;The Arthur Compton Lectures&quot; at the University of Chicago.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Furrer flew as a payload 
  specialist on the crew of STS-61A <i>Challenger</i> (October 30 to November

  to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first 
  in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. 
  More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological 
  sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. At mission conclusion 
  Dr. Furrer had traveled 2.5 million miles in 110 Earth orbits and had logged 
  over 168 hours in space.</p>
