<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>David R. Scott (Colonel, USAF, Ret.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born June 6, 1932, in San Antonio, Texas. 
  Married. Two children. Recreational interests include swimming, handball, skiing, 
  and photography.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Western High School, Washington, 
  D.C.; received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Military 
  Academy and the degrees of Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics 
  and Engineer in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute 
  of Technology; awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Astronautical Science from the 
  University of Michigan in 1971. He has graduated from the Air Force Experimental 
  Test Pilots School and Aerospace Research Pilots School.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Scott is a fellow of the American Astronautical 
  Society, Associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 
  and member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and Tau Beta Pi, Sigma 
  Xi and Sigma Gamma Tau.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, 
  the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, two Air Force Distinguished Service Medals, 
  the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Force Association's David 
  C. Schilling Trophy and the Robert J. Collier Trophy for 1971.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Scott graduated fifth in a class of 633 at 
  West Point and subsequently chose an Air Force career. He completed pilot training 
  at Webb Air Force Base, Texas, in 1955 and then reported for gunnery training 
  at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.</p>

<p>He was assigned to the 32d Tactical Fighter squadron at Soesterberg Air Base 
  (RNAF), Netherlands, from April 1956 to July 1960. Upon completing this tour 
  of duty, he returned to he United States for study at the Massachusetts Institute 
  of Technology.</p>

<p>He retired from the Air Force in March 1975 with the rank of Colonel and over 
  5600 hours of flying time.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Scott was one of the third group of 
  astronauts named by NASA in October 1963.</p>

<p>On March 16, 1966, he and command pilot Neil Armstrong were launched into space 
  on the Gemini 8 mission--a flight originally scheduled to last three days but 
  terminated early due to a malfunctioning thruster. The crew performed the first 
  successful docking of two vehicles in space and demonstrated great piloting 
  skill in overcoming the thruster problem and bringing the spacecraft to a safe 
  landing.</p>

<p>Scott served as command module pilot for Apollo 9, March 3-13, 1969. This was 
  the third manned flight in the Apollo series, the second to be launched by a 
  Saturn V, and the first to complete a comprehensive earth-orbital qualification 
  and verification test of a &quot;fully configured Apollo spacecraft.&quot; The 
  ten-day flight provided vital information previously not available on the operational 
  performance, stability, and reliability of lunar module propulsion and life 
  support systems. Highlight of this evaluation was completion of a critical lunar-orbit 
  rendezvous simulation and subsequent docking, initiated by James McDivitt and 
  Russell Schweickart from within the lunar module at a separation distance which 
  exceeded 100 miles from the command/service module piloted by Scott. The crew 
  also demonstrated and confirmed the operational feasibility of crew transfer 
  and extravehicular activity techniques and equipment, with Schweickart completing 
  a 46-minute EVA outside the lunar module. During this period, Dave Scott completed 
  a 1-hour stand-up EVA in the open command module hatch photographing Schweickart's 
  activities and also retrieving thermal samples from the command module exterior. 
  Apollo 9 splashed down less than four miles from the helicopter carrier USS 
  GUADALCANAL.</p>

<p>In his next assignment, Scott was designated backup spacecraft commander for 
  Apollo 12.</p>

<p>He made his third space flight as spacecraft commander of Apollo 15, July 26 
  - August 7, 1971. His companions on the flight were Alfred M. Worden (command 
  module pilot) and James B. Irwin (lunar module pilot). Apollo 15 was the fourth 
  manned lunar landing mission and the first to visit and explore the moon's Hadley 
  Rille and Apennine Mountains which are located on the southeast edge of the 
  Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The lunar module, &quot;Falcon,&quot; remained 
  on the lunar surface for 66 hours and 54 minutes (setting a new record for lunar 
  surface stay time) and Scott and Irwin logged 18 hours and 35 minutes each in 
  extravehicular activities conducted during three separate excursions onto the 
  lunar surface. Using &quot;Rover-1&quot; to transport themselves and their equipment 
  along portions of Hadley Rille and the Apennine Mountains, Scott and Irwin performed 
  a selenological inspection and survey of the area and collected 180 pounds of 
  lunar surface materials. They deployed an ALSEP package which involved the emplacement 
  and activation of surface experiments, and their lunar surface activities were 
  televised using a TV camera which was operated remotely by ground controllers 
  stationed in the mission control center located at Houston, Texas. Other Apollo 
  15 achievements include: largest payloads ever placed into earth and lunar orbits; 
  first scientific instrument module bay flown and operated on an Apollo spacecraft; 
  longest distance traversed on lunar surface; first use of a lunar surface navigation 
  device (mounted on Rover-1); first subsatellite launched in lunar orbit; and 
  first extravehicular (EVA) from a command module during transearth coast. The 
  latter feat performed by Worden during three excursions to &quot;<i>Endeavour</i>'s&quot; 
  SIM-bay where he retrieved film cassettes from the panoramic and mapping cameras 
  and reported his personal observations of the general condition of equipment 
  housed there. Apollo 15 concluded with a Pacific Ocean splashdown and subsequent 
  recovery by the USS OKINAWA.</p>

<p>He has logged 546 hours and 54 minutes in space, of which 20 hours and 46 minutes 
  were in Extravehicular Activity. He is only one of three Astronauts who have 
  flown both earth orbital and lunar Apollo Missions.</p>
