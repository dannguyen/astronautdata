<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Schmitt was a teaching fellow at Harvard 
    in 1961 where he assisted in teaching a course in ore deposits. Prior to his 
    teaching assignment, he did geological work for the Norwegian Geological Survey 
    on the west coast of Norway, and for the U.S. Geological Survey in New Mexico 
    and Montana. He also worked for two summers as a geologist in southeastern Alaska.</p>

<p>Before joining NASA, he was with the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Center 
at Flagstaff, Arizona. He was project chief for lunar field geological methods 
and participated in photo and telescopic mapping of the Moon, and was among 
USGS astrogeologists instructing NASA astronauts during their geological field 
trips.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 2,100 hours flying time -- 1,600 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p>Dr. Schmitt was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in June 1965. He later 
  completed a 53-week course in flight training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. 
  In addition to training for future manned space flights. He was instrumental 
  in providing Apollo flight crews with detailed instruction in lunar navigation, 
  geology, and feature recognition. Schmitt also assisted in the integration of 
  scientific activities into the Apollo lunar missions and participated in research 
  activities requiring geologic, petrographic, and stratigraphic analyses of samples 
  returned from the moon by Apollo missions.</p>

<p>He was backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 15.</p>

<p>On his first journey into space, Dr. Schmitt occupied the lunar module pilot 
  seat for Apollo 17 -- the last scheduled manned Apollo mission to the United 
  States --which commenced at 11:33 p.m. (CST), December 6, 1972, and concluded 
  on December 19, 1972. He was accompanied on the voyage of the command module &quot;America&quot; and the lunar module &quot;Challenger&quot; by
  Eugene Cernan (spacecraft commander) and Ronald Evans (command module pilot). In maneuvering &quot;<i>Challenger</i>&quot; to
  a landing at Taurus-Littrow, which is located on the southeast edge of Mare Serenitatis, Schmitt and Cernan activated a
  base of operations facilitating their completion of three days of exploration. This
    last Apollo mission to the moon for the United States broke several records 
    set by previous flights and include: longest manned lunar landing flight (301 
    hours, 51 minutes); longest lunar surface extravehicular activities (22 hours, 
    4 minutes); largest lunar sample return (an estimated 115 Kg, 249 lbs); and 
    longest time in lunar orbit (147 hours, 48 minutes). Apollo 17 ended with a 
    splashdown in the Pacific Ocean approximately 0.4 mile from the target point 
    and 4.3 miles from the prime recovery ship, USS TICONDEROGA.</p>

<p>Dr. Schmitt logged 301 hours and 51 minutes in space -- of which 22 hours and 
4 minutes were spent in extravehicular activity on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>In July of 1973 Dr. Schmitt was appointed as one of the first Sherman Fairchild 
  Distinguished Scholars at the California Institute of Technology. His appointment 
  was extended to run through July 1975. This appointment ran concurrently with 
  his other activities in NASA.</p>

<p>In February 1974, Schmitt assumed additional duties as Chief of Scientist-Astronauts.</p>

<p>Dr. Schmitt was appointed NASA Assistant Administrator for Energy Programs in 
  May 1974. This office has the responsibility for coordinating NASA support to 
  other Federal Agencies conducting energy research and development and for managing 
  NASA programs applying aeronautics and space technology to the generation, transmission, 
  storage, conservation, utilization and management of energy for terrestrial 
  applications.</p>

<p>In August of 1975, Dr. Schmitt resigned his post with NASA to run for the United 
  States Senate in his home state of New Mexico. He was elected on November 2, 
  1976, with 57% of the votes cast.</p>

<p>In January 1977, Schmitt began a six-year term as one of New Mexico's Senators 
  in Washington, D.C. His major committee assignments were on the Commerce, Science 
  and Transportation Committee; the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee 
  and the Select Committee on Ethics. He was the ranking Republican member of 
  the Ethics Committee; of the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee of Commerce, 
  and the Consumer Sub-committee of Banking.</p>

<p>Since 1982, Schmitt has worked as a consultant, corporate director, and free 
  lance writer and speaker on matters related to space, science, technology, and 
  public policy. In 1994, he was appointed as an Adjunct Professor of Engineering 
  at the University of Wisconsin and Chairman and President of the Annapolis Center 
  for Environmental Quality. DECEMBER 1994 This is the only version available from NASA. Updates must be
