Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and in March&nbsp;1971, he reported to the Third Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro, California and was assigned as wing operations analysis officer.  He flew UH-1E Huey helicopters in 1972 while with HML-267 at Camp Pendleton, California, and then went on to fly Huey helicopters with HML-367, First Marine Aircraft Wing, at Okinawa, Japan.  As an Aircraft Maintenance Officer with VMFA-451, Springer flew F-4 “Phantoms” and also attended the Navy Fighter Weapons School (Top Gun) while at Beaufort, South Carolina.</p>
<p>A 1975 graduate of the U. S. Navy Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland, he served as head of the Ordnance Systems Branch and was a test pilot for more than 20 different types of fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft.  In this capacity, he performed the first flights in the AHIT helicopter.  He graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1978 and was assigned to Headquarters Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, where he assumed responsibility for Joint Operational Planning for Marine Forces in NATO and the Middle East.  He was serving as aide-de-camp for the commanding general, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, when advised of his selection by NASA.</p>
<p>To date, Springer has logged more than 4,500 hours of flying time, including 3,500 hours in jet aircraft.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May of 1980, Springer became an astronaut in August&nbsp;1981.  His technical assignments have included support crew for STS-3, concept development studies for the Space </p>
<p>Operations Center and the coordination of various aspects of the final development of the remote manipulator system for operational use as well as working in the Mission Control Center as orbit CAPCOM for seven flights in 1984 and 1985.</p>
<p>Springer was responsible for Astronaut Office coordination of the Design Requirements Reviews (DRRs) and Design Certification Reviews (DCRs).  These review efforts encompassed the total recertification and reverification of the NSTS prior to STS-26 return to flight status.</p>
<p>Twice flown, Springer has logged more than 237 hours in space.  He was a mission specialist on STS-29 in 1989 and STS-38 in 1990.</p>

<p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-29 Discovery (March 13 to March 18, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  During 80 orbits of the Earth on this highly successful 5-day mission, the crew deployed a tracking and data relay satellite and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a space station heat pipe radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment.  In addition, the crew took more than 4,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70mm movie camera.  Mission duration was 119 hours and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.</p>
<p>STS-38 Atlantis (November 15 to November 20, 1990) was launched at night from Kennedy Space Center.  During the 5-day mission, the crew conducted Department of Defense operations.  After 80 orbits of the Earth, in the first shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985, Space Shuttle Atlantis and her crew landed back at Kennedy Space Center.  In completing his second mission, Springer logged more than 237 hours in space. </p>
