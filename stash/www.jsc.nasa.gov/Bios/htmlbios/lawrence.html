During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-86 <em>Atlantis</em> (September 25-October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station <em>Mir</em>.

Mission duration was 169 orbits in 259 hours and 21 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-91 <em>Discovery</em> (June 2-12, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> docking mission and marked the conclusion of the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. Mission duration was 235 hours and 54 minutes.</p>
