<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Slayton entered the Air Force as an
      aviation cadet and received his wings in April 1943 after completing flight
    training at Vernon and Waco, Texas.</p>

<p>As a B-25 pilot with the 340th Bombardment
      Group, he flew 56 combat missions in Europe. He returned to the United
    States in mid-1944 as a B-25 instructor pilot at Columbia, South Carolina,
    and later served with a unit responsible for checking pilot proficiency in
    the A-26. In April 1945, he was sent to Okinawa with the 319th Bombardment
    Group and flew seven combat missions over Japan. He served as a B-25 instructor
    for one year following the end of the war and subsequently left the Air Force
      to enter the University of Minnesota. He became an aeronautical engineer
      after graduation and worked for two years with the Boeing Aircraft Corporation
      at Seattle, Washington, before being recalled to active duty in 1951 with
    the Minnesota Air National Guard.</p>

<p>Upon reporting for duty, he was assigned
      as maintenance flight test officer of an F-51 squadron located in Minneapolis,
      followed by 18-months as a technical inspector at Headquarters Twelfth
    Air Force, and a similar tour as fighter pilot and maintenance office with
    the 36th Fighter Day Wing at Bitburg, Germany. Returning to the United States
      in June 1955, he attended the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force
      Base, California. He was a test pilot there from January 1956 until April
      1959 and participated in the testing of fighter aircraft built for the
    United States Air Force and some foreign countries.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 6,600 hours flying time, including 5,100 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Mr. Slayton was named as one of the Mercury
      astronauts in April 1959. He was originally scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas
      7 mission but was relieved of this assignment due to a heart condition
    discovered in August 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. Slayton became Coordinator
      of Astronaut Activities in September 1962 and was responsible for the operation
      of the astronaut office. In November 1963, he resigned his commission as
        an Air Force Major to assume the role of Director of Flight Crew Operations.
        In this capacity, he was responsible for directing the activities of
        the astronaut office, the aircraft operations office, the flight crew
        integration division, the crew training and simulation division, and
        the crew procedures division. Slayton was restored to full flight status
        and certified eligible for manned space flights in March 1972, following
        a comprehensive review of his medical status by NASA&rsquo;s Director
    of Life Sciences and the Federal Aviation Agency.</p>

<p>Mr. Slayton made his first
        space flight as Apollo docking module pilot of the Apollo-Soyuz Test
        Project (ASTP) mission, July 15-24, 1975&mdash;a
    joint space flight culminating in the first historical meeting in space between
    American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts. Completing the United States flight
    crew for this 9-day earth-orbital mission were Thomas P. Stafford (Apollo
    commander) and Vance D. Brand (Apollo command module Pilot). In the Soviet
    spacecraft were cosmonauts Alexey Leonov (Soyuz commander) and Valeriy Kubasov
    (Soyuz flight engineer). The crewmen of both nations participated in a rendezvous
    and subsequent docking, with Apollo the active spacecraft. The event marked
    the successful testing of a universal docking system and signaled a major
    advance in efforts to pave the way for the conduct of joint experiments and/or
    the exchange of mutual assistance in future international space explorations.
    There were 44 hours of docked joint activities during ASTP, highlighted by
    four crew transfers and the completion of a number of joint scientific experiments
    and engineering investigations. All major ASTP objectives were accomplished
    and included: testing a compatible rendezvous system in orbit; testing of
    androgynous docking assemblies; verifying techniques for crew transfers;
    and gaining experience in the conduct of joint international flights. Apollo
    splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and was quickly recovered
    by the USS NEW ORLEANS. Slayton logged 217 hours and 28 minutes in his first
    space flight.</p>

<p>From December 1975 through November
      1977, Slayton served as Manager for Approach and Landing Test Project.
      He directed the Space Shuttle approach and landing test project through
      a series of critical orbiter flight tests that allowed in-flight test and
      checkout of flight controls and orbiter subsystems and permitted extensive
      evaluations of the orbiter&rsquo;s subsonic flying
    qualities and performance characteristics.</p>

<p>He next served as Manager for
          Orbital Flight Test, directing orbital flight mission preparations
    and conducting mission operations. He was responsible for OFT operations
          scheduling, mission configuration control, preflight stack configuration
          control, as well as conducting planning reviews, mission readiness
    reviews, and postflight mission evaluations. He was also responsible for
    the 747/orbiter ferry program.</p>

<p>Slayton retired from NASA in 1982. He was
      president of Space Services Inc., of Houston, a company he founded to develop
    rockets for small commercial payloads.</p>

<p>Slayton died on June 13, 1993, in
      League City, Texas, from complications of a brain tumor.</p>
