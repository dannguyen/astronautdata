<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Kathleen (Kate) Rubins  (Ph.D.)</strong><br />
  <strong>NASA Astronaut</strong></p>
<p><span class="bioplainCAPS"><strong></strong></span><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong>  Born in 1978  in Farmington, Connecticut, and raised in Napa, California, where her father,  Jim, still resides.  Her mother, Ann  Hallisey resides in Davis, California.   She enjoys running, cycling, swimming, flying, scuba diving and  reading.  Kate is married to Michael  Magnani.  Michael&rsquo;s parents, Ellen and  Gil, reside in Homewood, California.    </p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>   Graduated from Vintage High School in 1996, received a Bachelor of  Science degree in Molecular Biology from the University of California, San  Diego, in 1999 and a Ph.D. in Cancer Biology in 2005 from Stanford University  Medical School Biochemistry Department and Microbiology and Immunology  Department.</p>
<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong>   American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), American  Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH), American Society for Virology  (ASV), RNA Society, Chi Omega, American Institute of Aeronautics and  Astronautics (AIAA)</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS</strong>:   Popular Science&rsquo;s Brilliant Ten (2009), National Science Foundation  Predoctoral Fellowship (2000), Stanford Graduate Fellowship - Gabilan Fellow  (2000), UCSD Emerging Leader of the Year (1998), Order of Omega Honor Society  Scholarship Award (1998)</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>:   Dr. Rubins conducted her undergraduate research on HIV-1 integration in  the Infectious Diseases Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological  Studies.  She analyzed the mechanism of  HIV integration, including several studies of HIV-1 Integrase inhibitors and  genome-wide analyses of HIV integration patterns into host genomic DNA.  She obtained her Ph.D. from Stanford  University and, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious  Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rubins and  colleagues developed the first model of smallpox infection.  She also developed a complete map of the  poxvirus transcriptome and studied virus-host interactions using both in-vitro  and animal model systems.  </p>
<p>Dr. Rubins then  accepted a Fellow/Principal Investigator position at the Whitehead Institute  for Biomedical Research (MIT/Cambridge, Massachusetts) and headed a lab of 14  researchers studying viral diseases that primarily affect Central and West  Africa.  She traveled to the Democratic  Republic of Congo to conduct research and supervise study sites.  Work in the Rubins Lab focused on poxviruses  and host-pathogen interaction as well as viral mechanisms for regulating host  cell mRNA transcription, translation and decay.   In addition, she conducted research on transcriptome and genome  sequencing of filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and Arenaviruses (Lassa Fever)  and collaborative projects with the U.S. Army to develop therapies for Ebola  and Lassa viruses.  Dr. Rubins has  published and presented her work in numerous papers at international scientific  conferences and in scientific journals.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Rubins was selected in July 2009 as 1 of 14  members of the 20th NASA astronaut class.   She recently graduated from Astronaut Candidate Training, which included  scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in International  Space Station (ISS) systems, Extravehicular Activity (EVA), robotics,  physiological training, T-38 flight training and water and wilderness survival  training. </p>
