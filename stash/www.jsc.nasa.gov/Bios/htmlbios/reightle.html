Selected for postgraduate education, he attended the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Redesignateded an aerospace engineering duty officer (AEDO) he was sent to transition training for the F/A-18 airplane with Strike Fighter Squadron 125 (VFA-125) at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California. He then reported for duty at the United States Naval Test Pilot School in March 1985, serving as the chief flight instructor until his selection for the astronaut program.</p>

<p>He has logged over 5,000 hours flying time in over 60 different types of aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected by NASA in June 1987, Reightler completed a year of astronaut candidate training and was designated an astronaut in August 1988.</p>

This was the first Space Shuttle flight in support of &quot;Mission to Planet Earth.&quot; During the five-day mission, the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery successfully deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere&rsquo;s chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. After 81 orbits of the Earth, STS-48 Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California.</p>

<p>Reightler next served as pilot on STS-60, the first joint U.S./Russian Space Shuttle Mission. Launching from the Kennedy Space Center on February 3, 1994, STS-60 was the first flight of the Wake Shield Facility (WSF-1) and the second flight of the Space Habitation Module (Spacehab-2). During the eight-day flight, the crew of Discovery, including Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, conducted a wide variety of biological, materials science, earth observation, and life science experiments. Following 130 orbits of the Earth, STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 11, 1994.</p>

<p>With the completion of his second mission, Reightler logged over 327 hours in space.</p>

<p>His technical assignments have included: Chief of the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch; Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch; Lead Spacecraft Communicator (CAPCOM); Lead Astronaut for flight software development and computer systems; Flight Crew Operations Directorate representative to the Shuttle Program Requirements Control Board; Weather Coordinator for Space Shuttle launches and landings; Astronaut Office representative in the areas of ascent, entry, and aborts.</p>
