<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Lodewijk van den Berg (Ph.D.)<br />
  Payload Specialist</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born March 24, 1932, in Sluiskil, The 
  Netherlands. Married, with two children. He is a U.S. Citizen.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Received a master of science in chemical engineering 
  from Technical University, Delft, The Netherlands, in 1961; a master of science 
  in applied science from the University of Delaware in 1972; and a doctor of 
  philosophy in applied science from the University of Delaware in 1975.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> American Association of Crystal Growth, 
  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. van den Berg has over 20 years of research 
  and management experience in preparation of crystalline materials, in particular, 
  growth of single crystals of chemical compounds and investigation of associated 
  defect chemistry and electronic properties. After van den Berg completed his 
  Ph.D., he joined EG&amp;G Corporation in Goleta, California, where he is responsible 
  for the operation of a crystal growing facility. This facility produces various 
  kinds of crystals via vapor transport methods. Dr. van den Berg is a co-investigator 
  on the Spacelab-3 mission Vapor Crystal Growth System (VCGS) experiment. In 
  that capacity, he is responsible for the crystal growth aspects of the VCGS 
  experiment. Dr. van den Berg has intimate knowledge of VCGS and Fluid Experiment 
  System (FES) hardware and has participated in all major design and science reviews 
  of those sytems. He has broad experience in crystal growth and characterization 
  including vapor transport, solution and melt growth techniques. He is an international 
  Authority on vapor growth techniques with emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals 
  and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. van den Berg flew on STS-51B 
  <i>Challenger</i> (April 29-May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was 
  launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards 
  Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The 
  seven-man crew aboard <i>Challenger</i> conducted investigations in crystal 
  growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric 
  trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, 
  laboratory animals and human medical monitoring. At mission conclusion, Dr. 
  van den Berg had traveled over 2.9 million miles in 110 Earth orbits, and logged 
  over 168 hours in space.</p>
