<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Anna L. Fisher (M.D.)</strong><br />
<strong>NASA Astronaut</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL  DATA:</strong>  Born August 24, 1949, in New York City, New York, but  considers San Pedro, California, to be her hometown.  Fisher enjoys snow and water skiing, jogging,  flying, scuba diving, reading, photography and spending time with her  daughters.  Her mother, Riley F. Tingle, formerly  of San Pedro, now resides in Houston.  Her  father is deceased.  </p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>  Graduated from San Pedro High School, San  Pedro, California, 1967; received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and a Doctor  of Medicine from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 1971 and  1976, respectively; received a Master of Science in Chemistry from UCLA, 1987.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL  HONORS:</strong>  Awarded a National Science Foundation  Undergraduate Research Fellowship, 1970, 1971;   Graduated from UCLA cum laude and with honors in chemistry;  NASA Space Flight Medal; Lloyd&rsquo;s of London  Silver Medal for Meritorious Salvage Operations; Mother of the Year Award, 1984;  UCLA Professional Achievement Award; UCLA Medical Professional Achievement  Award; NASA Exceptional Service Medal, 1999.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  After graduating from UCLA in 1971, Fisher  spent a year in graduate school, working in the field of x-ray crystallographic  studies of metallocarbonanes.  She  co-authored three publications relating to these studies for the Journal of  Inorganic Chemistry.  She began medical  school at UCLA in 1972 and, following graduation in 1976, commenced a one year  internship at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance, California.  After completing that internship, she  specialized in emergency medicine and worked in several hospitals in the Los  Angeles area.</p>
<p><strong>NASA  EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Fisher was selected as an astronaut by NASA  in January 1978.  In August 1979, she  completed a one year training and evaluation period, making her eligible for  assignment as a mission specialist on space shuttle flight crews.  Following her completion of training, Fisher&rsquo;s  early NASA assignments (pre-STS-1  through STS-4) included the  following:  crew representative to  support development and testing of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS); crew  representative to support development and testing of payload bay door  contingency spacewalk procedures, the extra-small Extravehicular Mobility Unit  (EMU) and contingency in-orbit Thermal Protection System (TPS) repair hardware  and procedures; verification of flight software at the Shuttle Avionics  Integration Laboratory (SAIL), where she reviewed test requirements and  procedures for ascent, in-orbit and Risk Management System (RMS) software  verification; and crew evaluator for verification and development testing for STS-2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>From STS-5  through STS-7, Fisher was assigned  as a crew representative to support vehicle integrated testing and payload  testing at NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  In addition, Fisher supported each Orbital  Flight Test (STS-1 through STS-4)  launch and landing (at prime or backup sites) as a physician in the rescue  helicopter and provided both medical and operational inputs on the development  of rescue procedures.  Fisher was also an  in-orbit Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) for the STS-9  mission.</p>
<p>Fisher was a mission specialist on STS-51A, which launched from Kennedy Space Center,  on November 8,   1984.  She was accompanied by  mission commander Frederick (Rick) Hauck pilot David M. Walker, and fellow mission  specialists, Joseph P. Allen and Dale H. Gardner.  This was the second flight of the orbiter  Discovery.  During the mission, the crew  deployed two satellites:  Canada&rsquo;s Anik  D-2 (Telesat H) and Hughes&rsquo; LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1) and operated the Radiation  Monitoring Equipment (RME) device and the 3M Company&rsquo;s Diffusive Mixing of  Organic Solutions (DMOS) experiment.  As the  first space salvage mission, the crew also retrieved the Palapa B-2 and Westar  VI satellites for return to Earth.  STS-51A completed 127 Earth orbits before landing  at Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 1984.   With the completion of her first flight, Fisher logged a total of 192  hours in space.</p>
<p>Fisher was  assigned as a mission specialist on STS-61H,  prior to the Challenger accident.   Following the accident, she worked as the deputy of the Mission  Development branch of the Astronaut Office and as the astronaut office representative  for Flight Data File issues.  In that  capacity, she served as the crew representative on the Crew Procedures Change  Board.  Fisher served on the Astronaut  Selection Board for the 1987 class of astronauts.  Fisher also served in the Space Station  Support office, where she worked part time in the Space Station Operations branch.  She was the crew representative supporting  space station development in the areas of training, operations concepts and the  health maintenance facility.</p>
<p>From  1989 through 1995, Fisher was on a leave of absence from the Astronaut Office  to raise her family, returning in January 1996. From 1996 through 2002, during  the early phase of building the International Space Station (ISS), Fisher was  the chief of the Space Station branch.   In that capacity, she coordinated inputs to the operations of the space  station for the Astronaut Office, working closely with all the international  partners and supervising assigned astronauts and engineers.  From January 2011 through August 2013, Fisher  served as an ISS Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) working in the Mission Control  Center and was also the lead CAPCOM for Expedition 33. Currently, Fisher is a management  astronaut, working on display development for the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew  Vehicle (MPCV) and supports European payloads for the ISS Integration branch. </p>
