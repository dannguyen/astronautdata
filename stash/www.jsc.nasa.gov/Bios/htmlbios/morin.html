      Space Station. Mission milestones included the delivery and installation
      of the SO (S-Zero) Truss; the first time the station's robotic arm was
      used to maneuver spacewalkers around the station; and the first time that
      all of a shuttle crew's spacewalks were based from the station's Quest
      Airlock. Morin performed two EVAs totaling 14 hours and 9 minutes. The
      crew prepared the station for future spacewalks and spent a week in joint
      operations with the station's Expedition 4 crew. Mission duration was 10
      days, 19 hours and 42 minutes.</p>
