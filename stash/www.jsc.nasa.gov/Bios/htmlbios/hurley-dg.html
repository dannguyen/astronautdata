    <p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Hurley received his commission as a Second
      Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps from the Naval Reserve
      Officer Training Corps at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, in
      1988.  After graduation, he attended The Basic School (TBS) in Quantico,
      Virginia, and later, the Infantry Officers Course.  Following Aviation
      Indoctrination in Pensacola, Florida, he entered flight training in Texas
      in 1989 and was designated a Naval Aviator in August 1991.  He then
      reported to Marine Fighter/Attack Training Squadron 101 at Marine Corps
      Air Station El Toro, California, for initial F/A-18 training.  Upon
      completion of training, he was assigned to Marine All Weather
      Fighter/Attack Squadron 225, where he made three overseas deployments to
      the Western Pacific.  While assigned to VMFA (AW)-225, he attended the
      United States Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) Course,
      the Marine Division Tactics Course (MDTC) and the Aviation Safety Officers
      Course at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California.  Over
      his 4 1/2 years with the “Vikings,” he served as the Aviation Safety
      Officer and the Pilot Training Officer.  Hurley was then selected to
      attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station
      Patuxent River, Maryland, and began the course in January 1997.  After
      graduation in December 1997, he was assigned to the Naval Strike Aircraft
      Test Squadron (VX-23) as an F/A-18 Project Officer and Test Pilot.  At
      “Strike,” he participated in a variety of flight testing, including flying
      qualities, ordnance separation and systems testing and became the first
      Marine pilot to fly the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet.  He was serving as the
      Operations Officer when selected for the astronaut program.  He retired
      from the United States Marine Corps in September, 2012, after more than 24
      years of service.</p>
    <p> Hurley has logged over 4,500 hours in more than 25 aircraft.  <strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Selected as a pilot by NASA in July
      2000, Hurley reported for training in August 2000.  Following the
      completion of 2 years of training and evaluation, he was assigned
      technical duties in the Astronaut Office, which have included Kennedy
      Operations Support as a “Cape Crusader,” where he was the lead Astronaut
      Support Personnel (ASP) for shuttle missions STS-107 and STS-121.  He
      worked Shuttle Landing and Rollout, served on the Columbia Reconstruction
      Team at Kennedy Space Center and in the Exploration Branch in support of
      the selection of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV).  He also
      served as the NASA Director of Operations at the Gagarin Cosmonaut
      Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, Russia.  In July 2009, Colonel Hurley
      completed his first spaceflight as pilot on STS-127, International Space
      Station Assembly Mission 2J/A.  Following that mission, Hurley served as
      the Astronaut Office Safety Branch Chief.  In July 2011, he completed his
      second spaceflight as pilot on STS-135, International Space Station
      Mission ULF7.  He has accumulated more than 683 hours in space and
      currently serves as the Assistant Director, New Programs, for the Flight
      Crew Operations Directorate (FCOD) at Johnson Space Center.</p>
    <p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-127, International Space
      Station Assembly Mission 2J/A, Endeavour (July 15 to July 31, 2009)
      delivered the Japanese-built Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) and the Experiment
      Logistics Module Exposed Section (ELM-ES) to the space station.  The crew
      completed the construction of the KIBO Japanese Experiment Module,
      installed scientific experiments on its Exposed Facility and delivered
      critical spare parts and replacement batteries to the orbital complex in
      addition to transferring 24,638 pounds of hardware and 1,225 pounds of
      water to the station.  While the shuttle was docked, the mission featured
      a record 13 astronauts working aboard the space station, representing all
      five International Partners:  NASA, the Russian Space Agency, the Canadian
      Space Agency (CSA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Space
      Agency (JAXA).  The 16-day mission included five spacewalks and was
      accomplished in 248 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6,547,853 miles in 15
      days, 16 hours, 44 minutes and 58 seconds.</p>
    <p> STS-135/ULF7, Atlantis (July 8 to July 21, 2011) carried the “Raffaello”
      Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) to deliver supplies, logistics and
      spare parts to the International Space Station. The mission also flew a
      system to investigate the potential for robotically refueling existing
      spacecraft and returned a failed ammonia pump module to help NASA better
      understand the failure mechanism and improve pump designs for future
      systems.  STS-135 was the 33rd flight of Atlantis, the 37th shuttle
      mission to the space station and the 135th and final mission of NASA’s
      Space Shuttle Program.  The mission, which included one spacewalk by
      Expedition 28’s Mike Fossum and Ron Garan, was accomplished in 200 orbits
      of the Earth, traveling 5,284,862 miles in 12 days, 18 hours, 27 minutes
      and 56 seconds.</p>
