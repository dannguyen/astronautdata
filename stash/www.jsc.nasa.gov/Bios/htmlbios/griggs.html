<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Mr. Griggs graduated from Annapolis in 1962 and entered pilot training 
    shortly thereafter. In 1964, he received his Navy wings and was attached to 
    Attack Squadron-72 flying A-4 aircraft. He completed one Mediterranean cruise 
    and two Southeast Asia combat cruises aboard the aircraft carriers USS Independence 
    and USS Roosevelt. Mr. Griggs entered the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at 
    Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1967, and upon completion of test pilot training, 
    was assigned to the Flying Qualities and Performance Branch, Flight Test Division, 
    where he flew various test projects on fighter and attack-type aircraft. In 
    1970, he resigned his regular United States Navy commission and affiliated 
    with the Naval Air Reserve in which he currently holds the rank of Rear Admiral.</p>

<p>As a Naval Reservist, Rear Admiral Griggs has been assigned to several 
      fighter and attack squadrons flying A-4, A-7 and F-8 aircraft based at Naval 
      Air Station New Orleans, LA, and Miramar, CA. His most recent assignments 
      have been as Commanding Officer, Attack Squadron 2082, Executive Officer, 
      Carrier Group 0282, mobilizing to Battle Force Sixth Fleet, Commanding Officer, 
      Naval Reserve Naval Space Command 0166 stationed at the Naval Space Command 
      Headquarters, Dahlgren, Virginia, and Commanding Officer, Office of Naval 
      Research/Naval Research Laboratory 410, Houston, Texas. Rear Admiral Grigg&#146;s 
      current mobilization assignment is as Chief of Staff Commander Naval Air 
      Force, United States Pacific Fleet, San Diego, California.</p>

<p>He has logged 9,500 hours flying time -- 7,800 hours in jet aircraft -- 
      and has flown over 45 different types of aircraft including single and multi 
      engine prop, turbo prop and jet aircraft, helicopters, gliders, hot air 
      balloons and the Space Shuttle. He has made over 300 carrier landings, and 
      holds an airline transport pilot license and is a certified flight instructor.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> In July 1970, Mr. Griggs was employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center 
    as a research pilot, working on various flight test and research projects 
    in support of NASA programs. In 1974, he was assigned duties as the project 
    pilot for the shuttle trainer aircraft and participated in the design, development, 
    and testing of those aircraft pending their operational deployment in 1976. 
    He was appointed Chief of the Shuttle Training Aircraft Operations Office 
    in January 1976 with responsibility for the operational use of the shuttle 
    trainer, and held that position until being selected as an astronaut candidate 
    by NASA in January 1978. In August 1979, he completed a 1-year training and 
    evaluation period and became eligible for Space Shuttle flight crew assignment.</p>

<p>From 1979 to 1983 Mr. Griggs was involved in several Space Shuttle engineering 
      capacities including the development and testing of the Head-Up Display 
      (HUD) approach and landing avionics system, development of the Manned Maneuvering 
      Unit (MMU), and the requirements definition and verification of on-orbit 
      rendezvous and entry flight phase software and procedures. In September 
      1983 he began crew training as a mission specialist for flight STS 51-D, 
      which flew April 12-19, 1985. During the flight, Mr. Griggs conducted the 
      first unscheduled extravehicular activity (space walk) of the space program. 
      The space walk lasted for over three hours during which preparations for 
      a satellite rescue attempt were completed.</p>

<p>At the time of his death, Mr. Griggs was in flight crew training as pilot 
      for STS-33, a dedicated Department of Defense mission, scheduled for launch 
      in August 1989. He died on June 17, 1989, near Earle, Arkansas, in the crash 
      of a vintage World War II airplane.</p>
