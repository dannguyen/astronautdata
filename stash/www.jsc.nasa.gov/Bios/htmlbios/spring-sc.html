<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> After graduation from West Point in 1967, 
  Spring served two tours of duty in Vietnam. The first was from 1968 to 1969 
  with the 101st Airborne Division. The second tour, 1970-1971, came immediately 
  after flight school and was served as a helicopter pilot with the 1st Cavalry 
  Division. Upon return, he received fixed wing training enroute to a master's 
  degree program with the University of Arizona in 1974. After a short tour at 
  Edwards Air Force Base, California, as a flight test engineer, he attended the 
  Navy Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland. He then returned to the 
  Army's Flight Test Facility at Edwards AFB to complete 4 years as an experimental

<p>He has military and civilian experience in 25 types of airplanes and helicopters 
  and has logged more than 3,500 hours flying time--including over 1,500 hours

  a mission specialist on STS-61B which flew November 26 thru December 3, 1985. 
  During that mission he was responsible for launching three communications satellites 
  and performed two EVA's. The EVA's, which totaled more than 12 hours, investigated 
  Space Station construction techniques, large structure manipulation while on 
  the end of the remote arm, and a time and motion study for comparison between 
  Earth training and Space performance. With the completion of STS-61B he has 
  logged a total of 165 hours in space, including over 12 hours of EVA.</p>

<p>Following his retirement form NASA in August 1988, Colonel Spring spent the
