<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from  Richland High School, Gibsonia, Pennsylvania in 1982. Received a bachelor of science degree in  aerospace engineering from the US Naval Academy in 1986, and a master of  science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate  School in 1994.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Society of  Experimental Test Pilots, U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Frick was commissioned upon graduation from  the U.S. Naval Academy in May 1986.  After being designated as a Naval Aviator in February 1988, he reported  to Strike Fighter Squadron 106 at Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, for  transition to the F/A-18 Hornet. Upon  completion of training, he reported to Strike Fighter Squadron 83 also at Cecil  Field, and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea onboard the USS  Saratoga (CV-60). During the 8-month  deployment, Frick participated in Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm,  flying 26 combat missions from the Red Sea to targets in Iraq and Kuwait. He  was also designated an airwing-qualified landing signals officer. After leaving Strike Fighter Squadron 83 in  December 1991, he participated in a cooperative program with the Naval  Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and the Naval Test Pilot School at  Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland resulting in a master's degree in  aeronautical engineering and designation as a Naval Test Pilot. Upon graduation in June 1994, Frick was  assigned as a project officer and test pilot to the Carrier Suitability  Department of the Strike Aircraft Test Squadron also located at Patuxent  River. While there he conducted  shore-based and shipboard testing of the F/A-18 Hornet. Frick was assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron  125 in Lemoore, California, preparing for return to a deployed F/A-18 squadron  when selected for the astronaut program in April 1996. Captain Frick retired from the U. S. Navy in  September 2010.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 4,300 flight  hours in 38 different aircraft, and has over 370 carrier landings.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected by  NASA in April 1996, Frick reported to the Johnson Space Center in August  1996. After initial Space Shuttle crew  training to qualify for flight assignment as a pilot, he has served in many  capacities in the Astronaut Office including lead capsule communicator (CAPCOM)  for the STS-114 return to flight mission, ascent and entry CAPCOM for multiple  launches and landings, and Chief of the Safety Branch. Outside of the Astronaut Office, Frick has  served as liaison to NASA HQ for return-to-flight activities after the Columbia  accident, and the Orion Spacecraft Project Flight Crew Testing Lead. Currently he is serving as Chief of the  Astronaut Office Exploration Branch. A  veteran of two spaceflights, Captain Frick has logged over 565 hours in  space. He served as pilot on STS-110 in  2002, and was the crew commander on STS-122 in 2008.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-110  Atlantis (April 8-19, 2002) was the 13th Shuttle mission to visit  the International Space Station. Mission  milestones included delivery and installation of the S0 (S-Zero) Truss, first  maneuvering of spacewalkers using the ISS robotic arm, and the first mission on  which all spacewalks were based from the station&rsquo;s Quest Airlock. The crew prepared the station for future  spacewalks and spent a week in joint operations with the station&rsquo;s Expedition-4  crew. The STS-110 mission lasted 10  days, 19 hours, and 42 minutes, and traveled 4.5 million statute miles in 171  Earth orbits.</p>

<p>STS-122 Atlantis (February 7-20, 2008)  was the 24th Shuttle mission to visit the International Space  Station. Mission highlight was the  delivery and installation of the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Columbus  Laboratory. Three spacewalks by the  Atlantis crew prepared the Columbus Laboratory for its scientific work, and  replaced an expended nitrogen tank on the Station&rsquo;s P-1 Truss. STS-122  was also a crew replacement mission, delivering Expedition-16 Flight Engineer,  ESA Astronaut L&eacute;opold Eyharts and returning home with Expedition-16 Flight  Engineer, NASA Astronaut Daniel Tani.  The STS-122 mission was accomplished in 12 days, 18 hours, 22 minutes, and  traveled 5.3 million statute miles in 203 Earth orbits.</p>
