<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> When informed by NASA of his selection 
  for astronaut training, he was assigned to the test directors section of Marine 
  Air Control Squadron Three, a unit responsible for the testing and evaluation 
  of the Marine Tactical Data System.</p>

<p>Carr began his military career in 1949 with the Navy, and 
  in 1950 he was appointed a midshipman (NROTC) and enrolled in the University 
  of Southern California. Upon graduation in 1954, he received his commission 
  and subsequently reported to the U.S. Marine Corps Officers' Basic School at 
  Quantico, Virginia. He received flight training at Pensacola, Florida, and Kingsville, 
  Texas, and was then assigned to Marine All-Weather-Fighter-Squadron 114 where 
  he gained experience in the F-9 and the F-6A Skyray. After postgraduate training, 
  he served with Marine All-Weather-Fighter-Squadron 122, from 1962 to 1965, piloting 
  the F-8 Crusader in the United States and the Far East. Other aircraft he has 
  flown include the F-4, T-1, T-28, T-33, T-38, H-13, and ground effect machines.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 8,000 flying hours, 5,365 hours of 
  which are jet time.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Colonel Carr was one of the 19 astronauts 
  selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as a member of the astronaut support 
  crews and as CAPCOM for the Apollo 8 and 12 flights, and was involved in the 
  development and testing of the lunar roving vehicle which was used on the lunar 
  surface by Apollo flight crews.</p>

<p>Carr was commander of Skylab 4 (third and final manned visit 
  to the Skylab Orbital Workshop) launched November 16, 1973, and concluded February 
  8, 1974. This was the longest manned flight (84 days, 1 hour, 15minutes) in 
  the history of manned space exploration to date. He was accompanied on the record-setting 
  34.5-million-mile flight by Dr. Edward G. Gibson (science pilot) and William 
  R. Pogue (pilot). The crew successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science 
  demonstrations, 15 subsystem-detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations 
  during their 1,214 revolutions of the earth. They also acquired extensive earth 
  resources observation data using hand-held cameras and Skylab's Earth Resources 
  Experiment Package camera and sensor array. They logged 338 hours of operations 
  of the Apollo Telescope Mount, which made extensive observations of the sun's 
  solar processes.</p>

<p>From February 1974 until March 1978, Colonel Carr and his 
  Skylab 4 teammates shared the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 
  hours 15 minutes 32 seconds, and Carr logged 15 hours and 48 minutes in three 
  EVAs outside the Orbital Workshop.</p>

<p>In mid-1977 Carr was named head of the design support group, 
  within the astronaut office, responsible for providing crew support to such 
  activities as space transportation system design, simulations, testing, and 
  safety assessment, and for development of man/machine interface requirements.</p>

<p>Carr retired from the United States Marine Corps in September 
  of 1975 and from NASA in June of 1977.</p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS:</strong> From 1977 until 1981 Carr was a Senior Vice 
  President with Bovay Engineers, Inc., a Houston Consulting Engineering Firm.</p>

<p>He was a Senior Consultant on Special Staff to the President 
  of Applied Research, Inc., Los Angeles, California, from 1981 to 1983. From 
  1983 until 1985 Carr was manager of the University of Texas 300-inch Telescope 
  Project.</p>

<p>Carr founded CAMUS, Incorporated in 1984. The Family-owned 
  Corporation provides technical support services in Zero-G Human Factors Engineering, 
  Procedures Development, Operations Analysis, Training and Systems Integration. 
  CAMUS was a major contributor as a technical support subcontractor to the Boeing 
  Company in the crew systems design of the International Space Station. In addition, 
  the corporation is involved in fine art production designed by his wife, Artist/Sculptor 
  Pat Musick.</p>
