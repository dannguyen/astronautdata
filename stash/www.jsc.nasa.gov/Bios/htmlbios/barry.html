<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Following
  graduate school at Princeton University, Dr. Barry was a National Science Foundation
  postdoctoral fellow in physics at Princeton. He then attended the University
  of Miami Medical School, graduating in 1982. He completed an internship and
  a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation residency at the University of Michigan
  in 1985. He was appointed as an assistant professor in the Department of Physical
  Medicine and Rehabilitation and in the Bioengineering Program at the University
  of Michigan in 1985, and his tenure was approved by the Regents in 1992. He
  spent the summers of 1985-87 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole,
  Massachusetts, supported by the Grass Foundation for work in skeletal muscle
  physiology and as the Associate Director of the Grass Foundation Fellowship
  Program (1986-87). His research primarily involved biological signal processing,
  including signal processing theory, algorithms, and applications to specific
  biological systems. The applications included acoustic signals generated by
  contracting skeletal muscle, electrical signals from muscle, and heart sounds.
  He has also worked in prosthetic design. Dr. Barry&rsquo;s work has been supported
  by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the
  Grass Foundation, and the American Heart Association of Michigan. He has five
  patents, over 50 articles in scientific journals, and has served on two scientific
  journal editorial boards.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected by NASA
  in March 1992, Dr. Barry reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992.
  He completed one year of training and qualified for assignment as a mission
  specialist on Space Shuttle flight crews. Dr. Barry has worked on primary payload
  development, the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), portable computing
  issues for Space Shuttle, Chief of Astronaut Appearances, flight clinic ombudsman,
  source board member for the NASA Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI),
  Astronaut Office team lead to NASDA, the Japanese Space Agency, Chief, ISS
  Hardware, US and International, and a tour of duty with the Office of Biological &amp; Physical
  Research and the Office of Education, NASA Headquarters, Washington D.C. A
  veteran of three space flights, STS-72 (1996), STS-96 (1999) and STS-105 (2001),
  Dr. Barry has logged over 734 hours in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling
  25 hours and 53 minutes. Dr. Barry retired from NASA in April 2005 to start
  his own company &ldquo;Denbar Robotics&rdquo; where he currently builds robots.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-72 <em>Endeavour</em> (January
    11-20, 1996) was a 9-day flight during which the crew retrieved the Space
  Flyer Unit (launched from Japan 10-months earlier), deployed and retrieved
  the OAST-Flyer, and Dr. Barry performed a 6 hour, 9 minute spacewalk designed
  to demonstrate and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International
  Space Station. Mission duration was 142 Earth orbits, traveling 3.7 million
  miles in 214 hours and 41 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-96 <em>Discovery</em> (May 27 to June
    6, 1999) was the 1st mission to dock with the International Space Station.
    It was a 10-day mission during which the crew delivered 4 tons of logistics
    and supplies in preparation for the arrival of the first crew to live on
  the station. The mission was accomplished in 153 Earth orbits, traveling 4
  million miles in 235 hours and 13 minutes. Dr. Barry performed a spacewalk
  of 7 hours and 55 minute duration.</p>

<p>STS-105 <em>Discovery</em> (Aug 10-22,
    2001) was the 11th mission to the International Space Station. While at the
    orbital outpost, the STS-105 crew delivered the Expedition-3 crew, attached
    the <em>Leonardo</em> Multi-Purpose
    Logistics Module, and transferred over 2.7 metric tons of supplies and equipment
    to the station. Dr. Barry and Pat Forrester performed two spacewalks totaling
    11 hours and 45 minutes of EVA time. STS-105 also brought home the Expedition-2
    crew. The STS-105 mission was accomplished in 186 orbits of the Earth, traveling
    over 4.9 million miles in 285 hours and 13 minutes.</p>
