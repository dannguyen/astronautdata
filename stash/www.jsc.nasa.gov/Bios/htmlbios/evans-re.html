<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Ronald E. Evans (Captain, USN Ret.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (Deceased)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born November 10, 1933, in St. Francis, 
  Kansas. Died April 6, 1990, in Scottsdale, Arizona, of a heart attack. He is 
  survived by his wife Jan and two children.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> He graduated from Highland Park High School 
  in Topeka, Kansas; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering 
  from the University of Kansas in 1956 and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical 
  Engineering from the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1964.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of Tau Beta Pi, Society of Sigma 
  Xi, and Sigma Nu</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Presented the NASA Distinguished Service 
  Medal in 1973; the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1970; 
  the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1973; Navy Astronaut wings; eight Air 
  Medals, the Viet Nam Service Medal; and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat 
  distinguishing service in 1966; the University of Kansas Distinguished Service 
  Citation in 1973; Kansan of the Year in 1972.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> When notified of his selection to the astronaut 
  program, Evans was on sea duty in the Pacific-assigned to VF51 and flying F8 
  aircraft from the carrier USS TICONDEROGA during a period of seven months in 
  Viet Nam combat operation.</p>

<p>He was a combat flight instructor (F8 aircraft) with VF-124 from January 1961 
  to June 1962 and, prior to this assignment, participated in two WESTPAC aircraft 
  carrier cruises while a pilot with VF-142. In June 1957, he completed flight 
  training after receiving his commission as an Ensign through the Navy ROTC Program 
  at the University of Kansas.</p>

<p>Total flight time accrued during his career is 5,100 hours, including 4,600 
  hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Captain Evans was one of the 19 astronauts 
  selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as a member of the astronaut support 
  crews for the Apollo 7 and Apollo 11 flights and as backup command module pilot 
  for Apollo 14.</p>

<p>On his first journey into space, Captain Evans occupied the command module pilot 
  seat for Apollo 17 which commenced at 11:33 p.m. (CST), December 6, 1972, and 
  concluded on December 19, 1972-the last scheduled manned mission to the moon 
  for the United States. He was accompanied on this voyage of the command module 
  &quot;America&quot; and the lunar module &quot;<i>Challenger</i>&quot; by Eugene 
  Cernan, spacecraft commander, and Harrison H. (Jack) Schmitt (lunar module pilot). 
  While Cernan and Schmitt completed their explorations of the Taurus-Littrow 
  landing area down on the lunar surface, Evans maintained a solo vigil in lunar 
  orbit aboard the &quot;America&quot;, completing assigned work tasks which required 
  visual geological observations, hand-held photography of specific targets, and 
  the control of cameras and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried 
  in the command module SIM-bay. Evans later completed a 1-hour, 6-minute extravehicular 
  activity during the transearth coast phase of the return flight, successfully 
  retrieving three camera cassettes and completing a personal inspection of the 
  equipment bay area. This last mission to the moon for the United States broke 
  several records set by previous flights which include: longest manned lunar 
  landing flight, 3 01 hours, 51 minutes; longest lunar surface extravehicular 
  activities, 22 hours, 4 minutes; largest lunar sample return, an estimated 115 
  kg, 249 lbs.; and longest time in lunar orbit, 147 hours, 48 minutes. Apollo 
  17 ended with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean approximately 0.4 mile from 
  the target point and 4.3 miles from the prime recovery ship, the USS TICONDEROGA.</p>

<p>Completing his first space flight, Captain Evans logged 301 hours, 51 minutes 
  in space-1 hour, 6 minutes of which were spent in extravehicular activity. He 
  holds the record of more time in lunar orbit than anyone else in the world.</p>

<p>Evans was backup command module pilot for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) 
  mission. This joint United States-Soviet Union earth-orbital mission, launched 
  successfully in July 1975, was designed to test equipment and techniques that 
  would establish an international crew rescue capability in space, as well as 
  permit future cooperative scientific missions.</p>

<p>Evans retired from the United States Navy on April 30, 1976, with 21 years of 
  service, and remained active as a NASA astronaut involved in the development 
  of NASA's Space Shuttle Program. He served as a member of the operations and 
  training group, within the astronaut office, responsible for launch and ascent 
  phases of the Shuttle flight program.</p>

<p>Evans retired from NASA in March 1977 to become a coal industry executive.</p>
