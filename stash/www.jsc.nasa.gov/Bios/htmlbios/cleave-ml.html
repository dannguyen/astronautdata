MARY L. CLEAVE (PH.D., P.E.)<br />
NASA ASTRONAUT (FORMER)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born February 5, 1947, in Southampton, New York.&nbsp; Her father, Dr. Howard E. Cleave, resides in Williamstown, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Her mother is deceased.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, New  York, in 1965; received a bachelor of science degree in Biological Sciences from Colorado State University in 1969 and master of science in Microbial Ecology and a doctorate in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Utah  State University in 1975 and 1979, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of the Society for Professional Engineers, the Association of Space Explorers, Women in Aerospace, Tri-Beta, Sigma XI, and Tau Beta Pi.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Cleave held graduate research, research phycologist, and research engineer assignments in the Ecology Center and the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State  University from September 1971 to June 1980.&nbsp; Her work included research on the productivity of the algal component of cold desert soil crusts in the Great Basin Desert south of Snowville, Utah; algal removal with intermittent sand filtration and prediction of minimum river flow necessary to maintain certain game fish; the effects of increased salinity and oil shale leachates on freshwater phytoplankton productivity; development of the Surface Impoundment Assessment document and computer program (FORTRAN) for current and future processing of data from surface impoundments in Utah; and design and implementation of an algal bioassay center and a workshop for bioassay techniques for the Intermountain West.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Cleave was selected as an astronaut in May 1980.&nbsp; Her technical assignments have included: flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); CAPCOM on five Space Shuttle flights; Malfunctions Procedures Book; Crew Equipment Design.&nbsp; A veteran of two space flights, Dr. Cleave has logged a total of 10 days, 22 hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02 minutes, 24 seconds in space, orbited the earth 172 times and traveled 3.94 million miles.&nbsp; She was a mission specialist on STS 61-B (November 26 to December 3, 1985) and STS-30 (May 4-8, 1989).&nbsp; Dr. Cleave left JSC in May 1991 to join NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,  Maryland.&nbsp; She worked in the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes as the Project Manager for SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing, Wide-Field-of-view-Sensor), an ocean color sensor which is monitoring vegetation globally.&nbsp; Dr. Cleave next served as Deputy Associate Administrator (Advanced Planning), Office of Earth Science, NASA Headquarters, Washington,  D.C.&nbsp; Dr. Cleave retired from NASA in February 2007.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-61B Atlantis (Nov. 26 to Dec.  3, 1985) launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.&nbsp; During the mission, the crew deployed the MORELOS-B, AUSSAT II, and SATCOM K-2 communications satellites, conducted 2 six-hour spacewalks to demonstrate space station construction techniques with the EASE/ACCESS experiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CFES) experiment for McDonnell Douglas and a Getaway Special (GAS) container for Telesat, Canada, conducted several Mexican Payload Specialist Experiments for the Mexican Government, and tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP).&nbsp; This was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the Space Shuttle to date.&nbsp; Mission duration was 165 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-30 Atlantis (May 4-8, 1989) was a four day mission during which the crew successfully deployed the Magellan Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle.&nbsp; Magellan arrived at Venus in August 1990 and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus.&nbsp; Magellan has been one of NASA&rsquo;s most successful scientific missions providing valuable information about the Venetian atmosphere and magnetic field.&nbsp; In addition, the crew also worked on secondary payloads involving Indium crystal growth, electrical storm, and earth observation studies.&nbsp; Mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds.</p>
