The seven-member crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 life science experiments focused on the effects of microgravity on the brain and central nervous system. The STS-90 crew orbited the Earth 256 times, and covered 6.3 million miles.</p>

<p>STS-130 (February 08&ndash;21, 2010). Space Shuttle Endeavour launched and landed at night on the thirty-second mission to assemble the International Space Station. The STS-130 crew delivered and outfitted Node 3, also known as Tranquility, and the Cupola, a seven-windowed portal for the space station.
