  Grove, Illinois.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Valparaiso High School, Valparaiso, 
  Indiana in 1969; received a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical and astronautical 
  engineering from Purdue University in 1973, and a master of science degree in 
  astronautical engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1980.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> NASA Space Flight Medal. Distinguished 
  Graduate from Air Force ROTC, Aerospace Defense Command &quot;We Point With 
  Pride&quot; Award, Air Force Command Pilot, Senior Space Badge, Defense Superior 
  Service Medal, two Air Force Commendation Medals, Air Force Outstanding Unit 
  Award, Combat Readiness Medal, National Defense Medal, and the Small Arms Expert 
  Marksmanship Ribbon.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Brown received his pilot wings at Laughlin 
  Air Force Base, Texas, in 1974. He was then assigned to the 87th Fighter Interceptor 
  Squadron at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, Michigan, where he flew both T-33 and 
  F-106 aircraft. In 1979 Brown was transferred to the Air Force Institute of 
  Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and received his master 
  of science degree in astronautical engineering in 1980.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Brown has been employed at the Lyndon 
  B. Johnson Space Center since 1980. Assigned as an engineer in the Flight Activities 
  Section, he participated in the development of contingency procedures for use 
  aboard the Shuttle and served as an attitude and pointing officer. Brown supported 
  STS flights 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 41-C in the Flight Activity Officer/Staff Support 
  Room of the Mission Control Center.</p>

<p>Selected by NASA in May 1984, Brown became an astronaut in June 1985, and qualified 
  for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. 
  In December 1985, he was assigned to the crew of a Department of Defense mission 
  which was subsequently canceled due to the <i>Challenger</i> accident. During 
  1986 and 1987, he served as an astronaut member of the solid rocket booster 
  redesign team. In February 1988 Brown was assigned to a new flight crew. He 
  flew on STS-28 (August 8-13, 1989), following which he served as astronaut member 
  on the Space Station Freedom Program. He next flew on STS-48 (September 12-18, 
  1991). With the completion of his second mission, Brown has logged over 249 
  hours in space.</p>

<p>On his first space flight, Brown served as a mission specialist on the crew 
  of STS-28. The Orbiter <i>Columbia</i> launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 
  on August 8, 1989. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a 
  number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission 
  concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, 
  California on August 13, 1989.</p>

<p>Brown next flew on the crew of STS-48 aboard the Orbiter <i>Discovery</i> which 
  launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1991. This was 
  a five-day mission during which the crew deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research 
  Satellite (UARS) which is designed to provide scientists with their first complete 
  data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew 
  also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals 
  to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. The mission was 
  accomplished in 81 orbits of the Earth and concluded with a landing at Edwards 
  Air Force Base, California, on September 18, 1991.</p>

<p>Brown will leave NASA in July 1993 and will retire from the U.S. Air Force to 
  head up the Space Division office of General Research Corporation in Dayton, 
  Ohio.</p>
