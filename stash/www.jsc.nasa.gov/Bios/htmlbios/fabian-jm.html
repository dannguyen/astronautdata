<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Fabian, an Air Force ROTC student at Washington 
  State University, was commissioned upon graduation in 1962. After an assignment 
  at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 
  Ohio, he was assigned as an aeronautics engineer in the service engineering 
  division, San Antonio Air Material Area, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. He then 
  attended flight training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and subsequently 
  spent 5 years as a KC-135 pilot at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan. He saw 
  action in Southeast Asia, flying 90 combat missions. Following additional graduate 
  work at the University of Washington, he served 4 years on the faculty of the 
  Aeronautics Department at the USAF Academy in Colorado. He has logged 4,000 
  hours flying time, including 3,400 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected as an astronaut candidate by 
  NASA in January 1978, and became an astronaut in August 1979. During the following 
  years, he worked extensively on satellite deployment and retrieval activities, 
  including development of the Canadian Remote Manipulator System. A veteran of 
  two space flights, he has logged over 316 hours in space. He served as a mission 
  specialist on STS-7 (June 18-24, 1983) and STS-51G (June 17-24, 1985). He was 
  scheduled to fly next in May 1986 on STS-61G. This flight was one of several 
  deferred by NASA in the wake of the <i>Challenger</i> accident . Fabian left 
  NASA on January 1, 1986 to become Director of Space, Deputy Chief of Staff, 
  Plans and Operations, Headquarters USAF.</p>

<p>Colonel Fabian retired from the USAF in June 1987 and joined Analytic Services 
  Inc (ANSER), a non-profit aerospace professional services firm in Arlington, 
  Virginia, where he is now President and Chief Executive Officer.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Fabian first flew as a mission 
  specialist on STS-7, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 
  18, 1983. This was the second flight for the Orbiter <i>Challenger</i> and for 
  the first mission with a 5-person crew. During the mission, the crew deployed 
  satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and Indonesia (PALAPA B-1); operated the Canadian-built 
  Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval 
  exercise with the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01); conducted the first formation 
  flying of the Orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01); carried and operated 
  the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2): and operated 
  the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex 
  Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven Getaway Specials, 
  Mission duration was 147 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, 
  on June 24, 1983.</p>

<p>On his second mission, Fabian flew on STS 51-G which launched from the Kennedy 
  Space Center, Florida, on June 17, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, 
  California, on June 24, 1985, after completing approximately 170 hours of space 
  flight. This international crew deployed communications satellites for Mexico 
  (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United Stated (AT&amp;T Telstar). 
  They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the 
  SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while 
  separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated 
  Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, participated 
  in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part 
  of the Strategic Defense Initiative.</p>
