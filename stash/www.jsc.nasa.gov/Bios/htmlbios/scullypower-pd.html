<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-41G <i>Challenger</i> (October 
  5-13, 1984) was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, 
  Florida. STS-41G was the first mission with a 7-person crew, and the first to 
  demonstrate American orbital fuel transfer. During the 8-day flight, the crew 
  deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations 
  of the earth with the OSTA-3 pallet and Large Format Camera, and demonstrated 
  potential satellite refueling with an EVA and associated hydrazine transfer. 
  At mission conclusion, Mr. Scully-Power had traveled over 3.4 million miles 
  in 133 Earth orbits, and logged over 197 hours in space.</p>
