  the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland, in June 1974, 
  and was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center's Carrier Suitability Branch of 
  Flight Test Division. From August 1976 to June 1977, following reorganization

  assigned to Attack Squadron 94 when selected by NASA.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 6,000 hours flying time, which includes 5,700 hours 
  in jets and 745 carrier landings.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected by NASA in January 1978, Williams 
  became an astronaut in August 1979, qualified for assignment as a pilot on future 
  Space Shuttle flight crews. Since then he has had various support assignments, 
  including working at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory as a test pilot, 
  and at the Kennedy Space Center participating in Orbiter test, checkout, launch 
  and landing operations.</p>

<p>From September 1982 through July 1983, he was assigned as the Deputy Manager, 
  Operations Integration, National Space Transportation System Program Office 
  at the Johnson Space Center. From July 1985 through August 1986, Williams was 
  the Deputy Chief of the Aircraft Operations Division at the Johnson Space Center, 
  and from September 1986 through December 1988, he served as Chief of the Mission 
  Support Branch within the Astronaut Office.</p>

<p>Twice flown, Williams served as pilot on STS-51D in 1985, and was the spacecraft 
  commander on STS-34 in 1989. He has logged a total of 287 hours and 35 minutes

  on several projects in the Houston area, nationally, and internationally.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-51D <i>Discovery</i> (April 
  12-19, 1985) was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, 
  Florida. During the mission, the crew deployed ANIK-C for Telesat of Canada, 
  and Syncom IV-3 for the U.S. Navy. A malfunction in the Syncom spacecraft resulted 
  in the first unscheduled EVA, rendezvous and proximity operations for the Space 
  Shuttle in an attempt to activate the satellite. Additional, the crew also conducted 
  several medical experiments, two student experiments, activated two Getaway 
  Specials, and filmed experiments with toys in space. The mission was accomplished 
  in 109 orbits of the Earth in 167 hours, 54 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-34 <i>Atlantis</i> (October 18-23, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space 
  Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. 
  During the mission the crew successfully deployed the Galileo spacecraft, starting 
  its journey to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet 
  Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, and performed numerous secondary 
  experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer morphology, lightning 
  research, microgravity effects on plants, and a student experiment on ice crystal 
  growth in space. The mission was accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth in 119 
  hours, 41 minutes.</p>
