<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Henry W. Hartsfield, Jr.  (Mr.)</strong><br />
  <strong>NASA Astronaut (Deceased)</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong>   Born in Birmingham, Alabama, on November 21, 1933.  Married to the former Judy Frances Massey of Princeton, North    Carolina.  Died  July 17, 2014 at the age of 80.</p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>   Graduated from West End High School, Birmingham,  Alabama; received a Bachelor of Science Degree  in Physics at Auburn University in 1954; performed graduate work in  physics at Duke University  and in astronautics at the Air Force Institute of Technology; and awarded a Master  of Science Degree in Engineering Science from the University of Tennessee  in 1971.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong>   Awarded the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal; General Thomas D. White  Space Trophy 1973, 1974;  Inducted into  Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame, 1983;   Distinguished Civilian Service Award (DOD), 1982;  NASA Distinguished Service Medals, 1982, 1988;  NASA Space Flight Medals, 1982, 1984, 1985;  NASA Exceptional Service Medal (1988);  Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Auburn University, 1986;  Presidential Rank of Meritorious Executive in  the Senior Executive Service, 1996.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Hartsfield received his commission through the Reserve Officer Training  Program (ROTC) at Auburn   University.  He entered the U. S. Air Force in 1955, and  his assignments included a tour with the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron in Bitburg, Germany.  He also graduated from the U.S. Air Force  Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was an instructor there  prior to his assignment in 1966 to the U.S. Air Force Manned Orbiting  Laboratory (MOL) Program as an astronaut.   After cancellation of the MOL Program in June 1969, he was reassigned to  NASA.</p>
<p>He has logged more  than 7,400 hours flying time -- of which over 6,150 hours are in the following  jet aircraft:  F-86, F-100, F-104, F-105,  F-106, T-33, and T-38.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Hartsfield became a NASA astronaut in September 1969.  He was a member of the astronaut support crew  for Apollo 16 and served as a member of the astronaut support crew for the  Skylab 2, 3, and 4 missions.</p>
<p>Hartsfield  retired in August 1977 from the United States Air Force with more than 22 years  of active service but continued his assignment as a NASA astronaut in a  civilian capacity.  He was a member of  the orbital flight test missions group of the astronaut office and was  responsible for supporting the development of the space shuttle entry flight  control system and its associated interfaces.</p>
<p>Hartsfield  served as backup pilot for STS-2 and STS-3, Columbia&rsquo;s second and third orbital flight  tests.  A veteran of three space flights,  Hartsfield logged 483 hours in space.  He  served as the pilot on STS-4 (June 27 through July 4, 1982), and was the  spacecraft commander on STS-41D (August 30 through September 5, 1984) and  STS-61A (October 30 through November 6, 1985).</p>
<p>From 1986 to  1987, Hartsfield served as the Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.  In 1987, he became the Deputy Director for  Flight Crew Operations, supervising the activities of the Astronaut Office and  the Aircraft Operations Division at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space  Center.</p>
<p>In 1989, he  accepted a temporary assignment in the Office of Space Flight, NASA  Headquarters, Washington, D.C.   There he served as Director of the Technical Integration and Analysis  Division reporting directly to the Associate Administrator for Space  Flight.  In this assignment he was responsible  for facilitating the integration of the International Space Station and its  unique requirements into the space shuttle systems.  His office also served as a technical forum  for resolving technical and programmatic issues.</p>
<p>In 1990, Mr.  Hartsfield accepted another temporary assignment as the Deputy Manager for  Operations, Space Station Projects Office, at the Marshall Space Flight Center,  Alabama.  In that capacity, he was  responsible for the planning and management of Space Station Operations and  Utilization Capability Development and operations activities including budget  preparation.  Later in that assignment,  he also acted as the Deputy Manager for the Space Station Projects Office.</p>
<p>In 1991, Mr.  Hartsfield accepted the position of the Man-Tended Capability (MTC) Phase  Manager, Space Station Freedom Program and Operations (SSFPO), with a duty  station at the Johnson   Space Center.  Reporting directly to the Deputy Director,  SSFPO, he represented the Deputy Director in providing appropriate program  guidance and direction to the Space Shuttle Program, and across the Space  Station Freedom Program for all MTC phase mission unique activities to assure  appropriate resolution of issues.</p>
<p>In December  1993, Mr. Hartsfield accepted the position of Manager, International Space  Station Independent Assessment.  In this  capacity, he reported directly to the Associate Administrator for Safety and  Mission Assurance and managed and focused the oversight activities and  assessment of the International Space Station Alpha Program.</p>
<p>In September  1996, the scope of Mr. Hartsfield&rsquo;s work was expanded to include independent  assessment of the programs and projects of the Human Exploration and  Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise  and he was named Director, HEDS Independent Assurance.  </p>
<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test  flight of the shuttle Columbia, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida,  on 27 June 1982.  He accompanied Thomas  K. Mattingly (spacecraft commander) on this 7-day mission designed to: further  verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; perform continued studies  of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the orbiter subsystems; and  conduct a survey of orbiter-induced contamination on the orbiter payload bay. Additionally,  the crew operated several scientific experiments located in the orbiter&rsquo;s cabin  as well as in the payload bay.  These  experiments included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES),  designed to investigate the separation of biological materials in a fluid  according to their surface electrical charge.   The crew was credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled  them to activate the first operational &ldquo;Getaway Special,&rdquo; which was comprised  of nine experiments that ranged from algae and duckweed growth in space, to  fruit fly and brine shrimp genetic studies.   STS-4 completed 112 orbits of Earth before landing on a concrete runway  at Edwards Air Force Base, California,  on July 4, 1982.  Mission  duration was 169 hours 11 minutes, 11 seconds. </p>
<p>STS-41D launched  from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984.  The crew included Mike Coats (pilot), Judy  Resnik, Steve Hawley, and Mike Mullane (mission specialists), and Charlie  Walker (payload specialist).  This was  the maiden flight of the orbiter Discovery.   During the 6-day mission, the crew successfully activated the OAST-1  solar cell wing experiment, deployed three satellites, SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and  TELSTAR 3-C, operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment,  and photography experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera.  The crew earned the name  &quot;Icebusters&quot; when Hartsfield successfully removed a hazardous  ice-buildup from the orbiter using the Remote Manipulator System.  STS-41D completed 96 orbits of Earth before  landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California,  on September 5, 1984.  Mission  duration was 144 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds.</p>
<p>STS-61A, the  West German D-1 Spacelab mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida,  on October 30, 1985. The crew included Steve Nagel (pilot), Jim Buchli, Guy  Bluford and Bonnie Dunbar (mission specialists), and Reinhard Furrer, Ernst  Messerschmid, and Wubbo Ockels (payload specialists).  The 7-day mission was the first with eight  crew members, and the first Spacelab science mission planned and controlled by  a foreign customer.  More than 75  scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences,  materials processing, biology, and navigation.   After completing 111 orbits of Earth, STS-61A landed at Edwards Air  Force Base, California,  on November 6, 1985.  Mission  duration was 168 hours, 44 minutes, 51 seconds.</p>
