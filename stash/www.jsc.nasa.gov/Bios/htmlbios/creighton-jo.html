NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born April 28, 1943, in Orange, Texas, 
  but considers Seattle, Washington, to be his hometown. Married to the former 
  Terry Stanford of Little Rock, Arkansas. Recreational interests include skiing,

  Washington, in 1961; received a bachelor of science degree from the United States 
  Naval Academy in 1966 and a master of science in Administration of Science and 
  Technology from George Washington University in 1978.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of the Society of Experimental 
  Test Pilots and the Association of Space Explorers.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Awarded the Defense Superior Service 
  Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, 10 air Medals, the Armed 
  Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, the NASA Distinguished

  Legion of Honor and the Saudi Arabia King Fahd Medal.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Creighton started flight training following 
  graduation from Annapolis and received his wings in October, 1967. He was with 
  VF-154 from July 1968 to May 1970, flying F-4J's and made two combat deployments 
  to Vietnam aboard the USS RANGER (CVA-61). From June 1970 to February 1971, 
  he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland, and 
  upon graduation was assigned as a project test pilot with the Service Test Division 
  at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River. During this two year tour of duty, 
  he served as the F-14 engine development project officer. In July 1973, Creighton 
  commenced a four year assignment with VF-2 and became a member of the first 
  F-14 operational squadron, completing two deployments aboard the USS ENTERPRISE 
  (CVN-65) to the Western Pacific. He returned to the United States in July 1977 
  and was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center's Strike Directorate as operations 
  officer and F-14 program manager. He has logged over 6,000 hours flying time, 
  the majority of it in jet fighters, and has completed 500 carrier landings and 
  175 combat missions.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected as an astronaut candidate by 
  NASA in January 1978, Creighton became an astronaut in August 1979. During the 
  following four years he held a variety of technical assignments in support of 
  the Space Shuttle Program. Following his first flight, Creighton became the 
  astronaut representative to the Shuttle Program Manager. During the ensuing 
  two years, Creighton participated in all the key decisions following the <i>Challenger</i> 
  disaster helping to shape the plan for resuming safe manned space flight. Starting 
  with STS-26, Creighton served as Lead &quot;CAPCOM&quot; for the first four 
  Space Shuttle flights. In March 1989 he was assigned to command STS-36 but continued 
  to serve as Head of the Mission Support Branch in the Astronaut Office until 
  commencing full time training for his upcoming flight. Following his second 
  flight, Creighton headed up the Operations Development Branch within the Astronaut 
  Office for one year prior to resuming full-time training for his next command. 
  Creighton served as pilot on STS-51G (June 17-24, 1985), was spacecraft commander 
  on STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990) and STS-48 (September 12-18, 1991), 
  and has logged over 403 hours in space. Captain Creighton left NASA and retired 
  from the Navy in July 1992. He is currently a Test Pilot with Boeing Airplane 
  Company.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-51G <i>Discovery</i> (June 
  17-24, 1985) was a 7-day mission during which the crew deployed communications 
  satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United States 
  (AT&amp;T Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy 
  and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy 
  experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated 
  the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, 
  participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment 
  as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Mission duration was 112 earth 
  orbits in 169 hours and 39 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-36 <i>Atlantis</i> (February 28 to March 4, 1990) carried Department of 
  Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. Mission duration was 72 
  earth orbits in 106 hours, 19 minutes, 43 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-48 <i>Discovery</i> (September 12-18, 1991) was a 5-day mission during which 
  the crew deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) which is designed 
  to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's 
  chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary 
  experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and 
  structures react in weightlessness. Mission duration was 81 earth orbits in 
  128 hours, 27 minutes, 34 seconds.</p>
