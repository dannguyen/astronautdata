<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>John H. Casper (Colonel, U.S.  Air Force, Ret.)</strong><br />
  <strong>Special Assistant for Program Integration</strong><br />
  <strong>Orion Program</strong><br />
<strong>Johnson Space Center</strong></p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL  DATA:</strong>  Born in Greenville, South Carolina, but  considers Gainesville, Georgia, to be his hometown.  Married to Beth Taylor Casper.  Four children.  He enjoys flying general aviation aircraft,  running, and classical music.</p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>  Graduated from Chamblee High School,  Chamblee, Georgia; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science  from the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado and a Master of Science degree in Astronautics  from Purdue University, West  Lafayette, Indiana.   He is a  graduate of the Air Force Air War College, Montgomery, Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Society of  Experimental Test Pilots; Association of Space Explorers; American Institute of  Aeronautics and Astronautics; Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the U.S.  Air Force (USAF) Academy Association of Graduates.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL  HONORS:</strong>  Awarded two Defense Meritorious Service  Medals; Defense Superior Service Medal; two Legion of Merit Awards; two  Distinguished Flying Crosses; 11 Air Medals; six Air Force Commendation Medals;  Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry; two NASA Distinguished Service Medals; NASA  Exceptional Service Award; NASA Medal for Outstanding Leadership; four NASA  Spaceflight Medals; the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement and the  Presidential Award as a Meritorious Executive in the Senior Executive Service.</p>
<p><strong>MILITARY  EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Casper earned his pilot wings at Reese Air  Force Base, Texas.  After F-100 training  at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, he flew 229 combat missions with the 35th  Tactical Fighter Wing at Phan Rang Air Base, Vietnam.  Following his tour in Vietnam, Casper flew  F-100 and F-4 aircraft, while assigned to the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, Royal  Air Force Lakenheath, United Kingdom.   Casper graduated from the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base,  California, and became chief of the F-4 Test team.  He flew initial performance and weapons  separation tests for the F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft and avionics tests for F-4E  and A-7 aircraft.  Casper then became operations  officer and, later, commander of the 6513th Test Squadron, where he conducted  flight test programs to evaluate and develop tactical aircraft weapons  systems.  He was then assigned to USAF Headquarters  at the Pentagon and was deputy chief of the Special Projects Office, where he  developed USAF positions on requirements, operational concepts, policy and  force structure for tactical and strategic programs.  Casper has logged more than 10,000 flying  hours in 52 different aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>NASA  EXPERIENCE:  </strong>Selected as an  astronaut by NASA in May 1984, Casper became an astronaut in June 1985.  A veteran of four spaceflights, he has logged  over 825 hours in space.  He was the  pilot on STS-36 (1990) and commander on missions STS-54 (1993), STS-62 (1994)  and STS-77 (1996).  His technical  assignments while in the Astronaut Office included: chief of the Operations  Development branch; lead for improvements to the nosewheel steering, brakes,  tires and development of a landing drag chute; astronaut team leader for the  Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and ascent/entry Capsule Communicator  (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center.</p>
<p>Following his last shuttle mission, Casper  has served in positions of increasing responsibility at NASA.  He was director of safety, reliability, and quality  assurance at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center, where he was responsible for all  safety, reliability and quality activities for human spaceflight programs,  including the International Space Station (ISS), the space shuttle, Space  Launch Initiative and Crew Return Vehicles.   He also was responsible for planning, directing and implementing an  effective institutional safety program to prevent injuries, loss of life or  loss of capital assets.</p>
<p>After the Columbia accident in February  2003, Casper served as the deputy of the NASA Mishap Investigation Team for the  Columbia debris recovery operation, which involved directing the efforts of more  than 6,000 ground, air and water search personnel as well as protection and  impoundment of debris. He was co-chair of the Return-ToFlight planning team, a NASA  Headquarters chartered independent team charged with addressing all actions  necessary to comply with the Columbia Accident Investigation Board  recommendations. He then joined the Space Shuttle Program and became manager of  the Management Integration and Planning Office and, later, associate manager of  the Space Shuttle Program.  He is  currently with the Orion Program as special assistant for Program Integration.</p>
<p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT SUMMARY:</strong>  STS-36 launched from NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space  Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990, aboard space shuttle Atlantis.  This mission carried classified Department of  Defense payloads and ??was unique in that it flew at 62 degrees inclination,  the highest inclination flown to date by the U.S. Human Spaceflight Program.  (I say delete that sentence). After 72 Earth  orbits, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air  Force Base- on March 4, 1990, after traveling 1.87 million miles.  Mission duration was 106 hours and 19  minutes.</p>
<p>STS-54 (January 13, 1993 through January  19, 1993) launched from the Kennedy Space Center on January 13, 1993, aboard space  shuttle Endeavour.  A crew of five successfully accomplished the  primary objectives of this six day mission, including deploying the $200  million NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-F), which joined four  other satellites to complete a national communications network supporting space  shuttle and other low-Earth orbit scientific satellites.  A Diffuse X-Ray Spectrometer (DXS), carried  in the payload bay, collected X-ray data to enable investigators to answer  questions about the origin of X-rays in the Milky Way galaxy.  A highly successful spacewalk resulted in  many lessons learned that benefited the International Space Station assembly.  The flight was also the first to shut down  and restart a fuel cell in flight, successfully demonstrating another space station  application.  Casper landed Endeavour at the Kennedy Space Center  on January 19, 1993, after 96 Earth orbits, covering over 2.5 million  miles.  Mission duration was 143 hours  and 38 minutes.</p>
<p>STS-62 (March 4, 1994 through March 18,  1994) was a two week microgravity research mission aboard space shuttle Columbia.  Its primary payloads were the U.S. Microgravity  Payload (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST-2)  payloads. These payloads included experiments to understand the process of  semiconductor crystal growth, investigating the process of metal alloys as they  solidify, studying materials at their critical points (where they exist as both  a liquid and gas) and testing new technology for use on future spacecraft, such  as advanced solar arrays, radiators, heat sinks and radiation shielding. The  flight also tested new technology for aligning the Remote Manipulator System  arm and grasping payloads with a new magnetic-end effector.  Columbia flew at a record low altitude of 195  km (105 nautical miles) to gather data on spacecraft glow and erosion caused by  atomic oxygen and nitrogen molecules.  Casper  landed Columbia at the Kennedy  Space Center after 224 Earth orbits and 5.82 million miles.</p>
<p>STS-77 (May 19, 1996 through May 29,  1996) was a ten day mission aboard space shuttle Endeavour.  The crew  performed several sequences (one with a SPARTAN satellite and three with a  deployed Satellite Test Unit) and approximately 21 hours of formation flying in  close proximity of the satellites.   During the flight, the crew also conducted 12 materials processing,  fluid physics and biotechnology experiments in a Spacehab Module.  STS-77 deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN  satellite, which carried the Inflatable Antenna Experiment that was designed to  test the concept of large, inflatable space structures.  A small Satellite Test Unit was also deployed  to test the concept of self-stabilization by using aerodynamic forces and  magnetic damping.  Casper brought Endeavour back to Earth at the  Kennedy Space Center after 160 Earth orbits and 4.1 million miles.  Mission duration was 240 hours and 39  minutes.</p>
