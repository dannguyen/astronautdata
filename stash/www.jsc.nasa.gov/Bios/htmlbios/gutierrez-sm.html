<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Gutierrez was a member of the National Collegiate 
  Championship Air Force Academy Parachute Team with over 550 jumps, and a Master 
  Parachutist rating. After graduation from the Academy he completed undergraduate 
  pilot training at Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas. He remained there 
  as a T-38 instructor pilot from 1975 through 1977. In 1978 Gutierrez was assigned 
  to the 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Hollomon Air Force Base, Alamagordo, 
  New Mexico, where he flew the F-15 Eagle. He attended the USAF Test Pilot School 
  in 1981 and was assigned to the F-16 Falcon Combined Test Force after graduation. 
  While there, Gutierrez served as primary test pilot for airframe and propulsion 
  testing on the F-16 aircraft. Test projects included the F-100 Digital Electronic 
  Engine Control, F-16C &amp; D Model Structural and Performance Testing, F-16 
  Maximum Performance Braking Tests, and F-16 Mobile Arrestment Qualification.</p>

<p>He has logged over 4,500 hours flying time in approximately 30 different types of airplanes, sailplanes, balloons, and rockets.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected by NASA in May 1984, Gutierrez 
  became an astronaut in June 1985. In his first technical assignment he served 
  as commander for the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), flying 
  simulated missions to verify Shuttle flight software. Following the Shuttle 
  <i>Challenger</i> accident he served as an action officer for the Associate 
  Administrator for Space Flight at NASA Headquarters. His duties included coordinating 
  requests from the Presidential Commission and the U.S. Congress during the investigation. 
  In 1986 and 1987, he participated in the recertification of the Space Shuttle 
  Main Engines, Main Propulsion System, and External Tank. In 1988, he became 
  the Astronaut Office lead for Shuttle software development, verification, and 
  future requirements definition. In 1989 he supported launches of STS-28, 30, 
  32, 33 and 34 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>

<p>A veteran of two space flights, he has logged over 488 hours in space. He was 
  the pilot on STS-40 (June 5-14, 1991) and was the spacecraft commander on STS-59 
  (April 9-20, 1994). After his first flight, Gutierrez served as spacecraft communicator 
  (CAPCOM) - the voice link between the flight crew and mission control - for 
  STS-42, 45, 46, 49 and 52. In 1992 he became the Astronaut Office Branch Chief 
  for Operations Development, overseeing ascent, entry, abort, software, rendezvous, 
  Shuttle systems, main engines, solid rocket boosters, external tank, and landing 
  and rollout issues.</p>

<p>In September 1994, Gutierrez retired from the U.S. Air Force and NASA, returned 
  to his native home of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined Sandia National Laboratories. 
  From September 1994 to March 1995, he served as Manager for their Strategic 
  Initiatives Department. In March he became Manager of the Airborne Sensors and 
  Integration Department in the Exploratory Systems Development Center. He also 
  served as Chairman of the Governor's Technical Excellence Committee Spaceport 
  Task Force.</p>

<p>Gutierrez serves on the Board of Directors of the Texas-New Mexico Power Company 
  and Goodwill Industries of New Mexico and is a member of the New Mexico Space 
  Center's Governor's Commission.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences 
  (SLS-1), a dedicated space and life sciences mission, which launched from the 
  Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 5, 1991. SLS-1 was a nine-day mission 
  during which the crew performed experiments which explored how humans, animals, 
  and cells respond to microgravity and re-adapt to Earth's gravity on return. 
  Other payloads included experiments designed to investigate materials science, 
  plant biology and cosmic radiation. Following 146 orbits of the Earth, <i>Columbia</i> 
  and her crew returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 
  14, 1991. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes, 20 seconds.</p>

<p>STS-59 Space Radar Laboratory (SRL-1), part of Mission to Planet Earth, was 
  an 11-day flight dedicated to the study of the Earth and the atmosphere around 
  it. The two primary payloads were the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic 
  Aperature Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and Measurement of Air Pollution from Space (MAPS). 
  The crew completed over 400 precise maneuvers (a Shuttle record) to properly 
  point the radar, imaged over 400 selected sites with approximately 14,000 photographs 
  (a Shuttle record) and recorded enough data to fill 26,000 encyclopedias. Areas 
  of investigation included ecology, oceanography, geology, and hydrology. Launching 
  on April 9, 1994, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the <i>Endeavour</i> 
  and her crew of six completed 183 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards 
  AFB, California, on April 20, 1994.</p>
