<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Parramatta High School in Parramatta, 
  N.S.W., Australia; received a bachelor of science degree in Physics and Mathematics 
  from Sydney University in 1956; and from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
  a master of science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1964 and a Doctorate 
  of Science in Instrumentation in 1967.</p>
