<p>He has logged 4,500 hours flying time.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Captain Kerwin was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in June 1965.</p>

<p>Kerwin served as science-pilot for the Skylab 2 (SL-2) mission which launched 
  on May 25 and terminated on June 22, 1973. With him for the initial activation 
  and 28-day flight qualification operations of the Skylab orbital workshop were 
  Charles Conrad, Jr., (spacecraft commander) and Paul J. Weitz (pilot).</p>

<p>Kerwin was subsequently in charge of the on-orbit branch of the Astronaut Office, 
  where he coordinated astronaut activity involving rendezvous, satellite deployment 
  and retrieval, and other Shuttle payload operations.</p>

<p>From 1982-1983, Kerwin served as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
  senior science representative in Australia. In this capacity, he served as liaison 
  between NASA's Office of Space Tracking and Data Systems and Australia's Department 
  of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>From 1984-1987, he served as Director, Space and Life Sciences, Johnson Space 
  Center. Kerwin was responsible for direction and coordination of medical support 
  to operational manned spacecraft programs, including health care and maintenance 
  of the astronauts and their families; for direction of life services, supporting 
  research and light experiment project; and for managing JSC earth sciences and 
  scientific efforts in lunar and planetary research.</p>

<p>He retired from the Navy, left NASA and joined Lockheed in 1987.</p>

<p>At Lockheed he managed the Extravehicular Systems Project, providing hardware 
  for Space Station Freedom, from 1988 to 1990; with two other Lockheed employees
