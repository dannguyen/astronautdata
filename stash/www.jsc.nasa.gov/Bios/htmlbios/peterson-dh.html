<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Donald H. Peterson (Colonel, USAF, ret.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born in Winona, Mississippi, on October 
  22, 1933. Married. Three children and four grandchildren.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Winona City High School, Winona, 
  Mississippi; received a bachelor of science degree from the United States Military 
  Academy at West Point, New York, in 1955, and a master's degree in Nuclear Engineering 
  from the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 
  Ohio, in 1962.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal, 
  the Meritorious Service Medal, and the JSC Group Achievement Award (1972).</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Peterson graduated from West Point in 1955. 
  His assignments included four years as a flight instructor and military training 
  officer with the Air Training Command, three years as a nuclear systems analyst 
  with the Air Force Systems Command, and one year as a fighter pilot with Tactical 
  Air Command, including 3 months combat weapons training.</p>

<p>He is a graduate of the Aerospace Research Pilot School. Edwards Air Force Base, 
  California, and was one of the third group of astronauts assigned to the USAF 
  Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program.</p>

<p>He has logged over 5,300 hours flying time--including more than 5,000 hours 
  in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Peterson became a NASA astronaut in 
  September 1969. He served on the astronaut support crew for Apollo 16.</p>

<p>Peterson retired from the United States Air Force with the rank of colonel after 
  having completed more than 24 years of active service, but continued his assignment 
  as a NASA astronaut in a civilian capacity. His areas of responsibility have 
  included engineering support, man/machine interface, and safety assessment.</p>

<p>Peterson was a mission specialist on STS-6, which launched from Kennedy Space 
  Center, Florida, on April 4, 1983. He was accompanied by Mr. Paul J. Weitz (spacecraft 
  commander), Col. Karol J. Bobko (pilot), and Dr. F. Story Musgrave (mission 
  specialist). During this maiden voyage of the spacecraft <i>Challenger</i>, 
  the STS-6 crew conducted numerous experiments in materials processing, recorded 
  lightning activities, deployed the first Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-A), 
  and activated three Getaway Specials. Peterson and Musgrave conducted an extravehicular 
  activity (EVA), commonly called a &quot;spacewalk,&quot; to test the new suit, 
  the Shuttle airlock, and new tools and techniques for construction and repair 
  outside a spacecraft. After 120 hours of orbital operations STS-6 landed on 
  the concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 9, 1983. 
  With the completion of this flight Don Peterson has logged 4 hours 15 minutes 
  in extravehicular activity, and a total of 120 hours in space.</p>

<p><strong>POST-NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Peterson resigned from the Astronaut 
  Office in November 1984, and since that time has worked as a consultant in the 
  area of manned aerospace operations.</p>
