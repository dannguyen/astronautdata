      Following graduation, he was assigned as the Assistant Air Operations
      Officer on the USS CORAL SEA (CV 43) homeported in Norfolk, Virginia. Upon
      selection to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) in 1989, he moved
      to NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. He graduated from USNTPS in June 1990,
      and was assigned to the Force Warfare Aircraft Test Directorate. In 1991,
      he was reassigned as a Flight Instructor and the Operations Officer at
      USNTPS. During his tenure there, he instructed in the F-18, P-3, T-2,
      T-38, U-21, U-6 and X-26 glider. In 1993, Foreman was assigned to the
      Naval Air Systems Command in Crystal City, Virginia, first as the Deputy
      and then as the Class Desk (Chief Engineer) Officer for the T-45 Goshawk
      aircraft program. Following that tour, he returned to NAS Patuxent River,

      of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division. In addition to his
      duties at Patuxent River, he was assigned as the Navy liaison to NASA’s
      Advanced Orbiter Cockpit Project at the Johnson Space Center. Foreman was
      working as the Technical Lead for the Advanced Orbiter Cockpit Project
      team when he was selected for the Astronaut Program. He retired from the
      Navy in June 2009.</p>
    <p>Foreman has logged over 7,000 hours in more than 50 different aircraft.</p>
    <p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected by NASA in June 1998, he
      reported for training in August 1998. Astronaut Candidate Training
      included orientation briefings and tours, numerous scientific and
      technical briefings, intensive instruction in shuttle and International
      Space Station systems, physiological training and ground school to prepare
      for T-38 flight training as well as learning water and wilderness survival
      techniques. He was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut
      Office Space Station Branch, where he represented the Astronaut Office on
      training issues. He was then assigned to the Space Shuttle Branch as a
      liaison between the Johnson Space Center and the Kennedy Space Center and
      also served as Deputy of the Space Shuttle Branch. Foreman also served as
      Chief of External Programs at Glenn Research Center, Ohio, from June 2010
      to May 2011. Foreman is currently assigned as the Safety Branch Chief in
      the Astronaut Office. He also supports the Exploration Branch, working on
      the Commercial Crew Development Program. A veteran of two space flights,
      Foreman flew on STS-123 in March 2008, and STS-129 in November 2009, and
      has logged more than 637 hours in space, including 32 hours and 19 minutes
      of EVA in five spacewalks.</p>
    <p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-123 Endeavour (March 11 to
      March 26, 2008) was a night launch and landing. It was the 25th
      shuttle/station assembly mission. Endeavour’s crew delivered the Japanese
      Experiment Logistics Module - Pressurized Section, the first pressurized
      component of Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA’s) Kibo
      Laboratory and the final element of the station’s Mobile Servicing System,
      the Canadian-built Dextre, also known as the Special Purpose Dextrous
      Manipulator. While on the station, Foreman performed three spacewalks for
      a total of 19 hours and 34 minutes of EVA. The STS 123 crew also delivered
      Expedition 16 Flight Engineer Garrett Reisman, and returned to Earth with
      the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Léopold Eyharts. The mission was
      accomplished in 250 orbits of the Earth, traveling more than 6.5 million
      miles in 15 days, 18 hours, 10 minutes and 54 seconds.</p>
    <p>STS-129 (November 16 to November 29, 2009) was the 31st shuttle flight to
      the International Space Station. During the mission, the crew delivered
      two Express Logistics Carriers (ELC racks) to the space station, about
      30,000 pounds of replacement parts for systems that provide power to the
      station, keep it from overheating and maintain proper orientation in
      space. During the mission, Foreman performed two spacewalks for a total of
      12 hours and 45 minutes of EVA. The STS-129 mission was completed in 10
      days, 19 hours, 16 minutes and 13 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in
      171 orbits, and returned to Earth, bringing back with them NASA’s Nicole
      Stott, following her tour of duty aboard the station.</p>
