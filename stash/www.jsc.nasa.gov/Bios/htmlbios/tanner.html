<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Joseph R. &quot;Joe&quot; Tanner<br />
NASA Astronaut (FORMER)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born in Illinois  in 1950. Married. Two children.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Danville High School, Danville,  Illinois, in 1968; received a bachelor of  science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois  in 1973.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> NASA  Distinguished Service Medal. NASA  Exceptional Service Medals. NASA Space  Flight Medals. NASA Stuart M. Present  Flight Achievement Award. JSC Superior Achievement Award. Multiple Group and Team Achievement  Awards. Outstanding Alumnus of the  Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois. Distinguished graduate from Navy Flight  Training. Captain of the Swimming Team  and &quot;Top 100 Seniors&quot; Award at University of Illinois. Eagle Scout.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Tanner  joined the Navy after graduating from the University of Illinois  in 1973. He earned his Navy pilot wings  in 1975 before serving as an A-7E pilot with Light Attack Squadron 94 (VA-94)  aboard the U.S.S. Coral Sea. He finished  his active service as an advanced jet instructor pilot with Training Squadron 4  (VT-4) in Pensacola, Florida.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Tanner  started working for NASA   Johnson Space   Center in 1984 as an  aerospace engineer and research pilot.  His primary flying responsibilities involved teaching the astronaut  pilots Space Shuttle landing techniques in the Shuttle Training Aircraft and  instructing the pilots and mission specialists in the T-38. In addition to his flying duties, Tanner held  positions as the aviation safety officer, the head of the pilot section, and  the Deputy Chief of the Aircraft Operations Division (AOD). He has accumulated more than 8,900 hours in  military and NASA aircraft.</p>

<p>Selected as an astronaut  candidate by NASA in March 1992, Tanner reported to the Astronaut Office in  August 1992. He completed one year of  initial training and worked in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory  before being assigned to his first mission.  Tanner also served as part of the Astronaut Support Personnel team at  the Kennedy Space Center, supporting Space Shuttle launches and landings, and  as EVA Branch Chief. A veteran of four  space flights Tanner has logged over 1069 hours in space, including over 46 EVA  hours in 7 space walks. He served as a  mission specialist on STS-66 in  1994, STS-82 in 1997, STS-97 in 2000, and STS-115  in 2006.</p>

<p>Tanner  retired from NASA in August 2008.  Currently Tanner is a Senior Instructor in the University  of Colorado Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department in Boulder, Colorado, teaching and mentoring  undergraduate and graduate students in space systems design. He is also a self-employed aerospace systems  consultant.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Tanner flew aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-66, November 3-14, 1994, performing the  Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) mission. ATLAS-3 was the third in a series of flights  to study the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere composition and solar effects at several points  during the Sun&rsquo;s 11-year cycle. The mission  also carried the CRISTA-SPAS satellite that was deployed to study the chemical  composition of the middle atmosphere and retrieved later in the mission. Tanner logged 262 hours and 34 minutes in  space and 175 orbits of the Earth.</p>

<p>Tanner performed two  space walks as a member of the STS-82  crew to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in February, 1997. The STS-82  crew of 7 launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery on February 11 and returned  to a night landing at Kennedy   Space Center  on February 21. During the flight the  crew completed a total of 5 space walks to improve the science capability of  the telescope and replace aging support equipment, restoring HST to near  perfect working condition. The crew  boosted HST&rsquo;s orbit by 8 nautical miles before releasing it to once again study  the universe. Tanner&rsquo;s two space walks  totaled 14 hours and 01 minutes. The  flight orbited the earth 150 times covering 4.1 million miles in 9 days, 23  hours, 37 minutes.</p>

<p>Tanner&rsquo;s  third mission was STS-97 aboard Endeavour (November 30 to December 11, 2000),  the fifth Space Shuttle mission dedicated to the assembly of the International  Space Station. While docked to the  Station, the crew installed the first set of U.S. solar arrays, in addition to  delivering supplies and equipment to the station&rsquo;s first resident crew. Tanner performed three space walks totaling  19 hours 20 minutes. Mission  duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 57 minutes, and covered 4.47 million  miles.</p>

<p>Tanner  next served on the crew of STS-115  Atlantis (September 9-21, 2006) which successfully restarted assembly of the International  Space Station. During the 12-day mission  the crew delivered and installed the massive P3/P4 truss, and two sets of solar  arrays that will eventually provide one quarter of the station&rsquo;s power. The crew also performed unprecedented robotic  work using the Shuttle&rsquo;s arm. With EVA  partner Heide Piper, Tanner made two spacewalks totaling 13 hours and 8 minutes  in order to complete truss installation and preparation for solar array and  radiator deployment. The mission  duration was 11 days, 19 hours and 6 minutes and covered 4.87 million miles.</p>
