<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Alan B. Shepard, Jr. (Rear Admiral, USN, Ret.)<br />
  NASA Astronaut (Deceased)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born November 18, 1923, in East Derry, 
  New Hampshire. Died on July 21, 1998. His wife, Louise, died on August 25, 1998. 
  They are survived by daughters Julie, Laura and Alice, and six grandchildren.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Attended primary and secondary schools in 
  East Derry and Derry, New Hampshire; received a Bachelor of Science degree from 
  the United States Naval Academy in 1944, an Honorary Master of Arts degree from 
  Dartmouth College in 1962, and Honorary Doctorate of Science from Miami University 
  (Oxford, Ohio) in 1971, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Franklin 
  Pierce College in 1972. Graduated Naval Test Pilot School in 1951; Naval War 
  College, Newport, Rhode Island in 1957.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Fellow of the American Astronautical Society 
  and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots; member of the Rotary, the Kiwanis, 
  the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati, and the American Fighter 
  Aces; honorary member, Board of Directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, 
  Director, National Space Institute, and Director, Los Angeles Ear Research Institute.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Congressional Medal of Honor (Space); 
  Awarded two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, the NASA Exceptional Service 
  Medal, the Navy Astronaut Wings, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the 
  Navy Distinguished Flying Cross; recipient of the Langley Medal (highest award 
  of the Smithsonian Institution) on May 5, 1964, the Lambert Trophy, the Kinchloe 
  Trophy, the Cabot Award, the Collier Trophy, the City of New York Gold Medal 
  (1971), Achievement Award for 1971. Shepard was appointed by the President in 
  July 1971 as a delegate to the 26th United Nations General Assembly and served 
  through the entire assembly which lasted from September to December 1971.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Shepard began his naval career, after graduation 
  from Annapolis, on the destroyer COGSWELL, deployed in the pacific during World 
  War II. He subsequently entered flight training at Corpus Christi, Texas, and 
  Pensacola, Florida, and received his wings in 1947. His next assignment was 
  with Fighter Squadron 42 at Norfolk, Virginia, and Jacksonville, Florida. He 
  served several tours aboard aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean while with 
  this squadron.</p>

<p>In 1950, he attended the United States Navy Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, 
  Maryland. After graduation, he participated in flight test work which included 
  high- altitude tests to obtain data on light at different altitudes and on a 
  variety of air masses over the American continent; and test and development 
  experiments of the Navy's in-flight refueling system, carrier suitability trails 
  of the F2H3 Banshee, and Navy trials of the first angled carrier deck. He was 
  subsequently assigned to Fighter Squadron 193 at Moffett Field, California, 
  a night fighter unit flying Banshee jets. As operations officer of this squadron, 
  he made two tours to the Western pacific onboard the carrier ORISKANY.</p>

<p>He returned to Patuxent for a second tour of duty and engaged in flight testing 
  the F3H Demon, F8U Crusader, F4D Skyray, and F11F Tigercat. He was also project 
  test pilot on the F5D Skylancer, and his last five months at Patuxent were spent 
  as an instructor in the Test Pilot School. He later attended the Naval War College 
  at Newport, Rhode Island, and upon graduating in 1957 was subsequently assigned 
  to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, as aircraft readiness 
  officer.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 8,000 hours flying time--3,700 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Rear Admiral Shepard was one of the 
  Mercury astronauts named by NASA in April 1959, and he holds the distinction 
  of being the first American to journey into space. On May 5, 1961, in the Freedom 
  7 spacecraft, he was launched by a Redstone vehicle on a ballistic trajectory 
  suborbital flight--a flight which carried him to an altitude of 116 statute 
  miles and to a landing point 302 statute miles down the Atlantic Missile Range.</p>

<p>In 1963, he was designated Chief of the Astronaut Office with responsibility 
  for monitoring the coordination, scheduling, and control of all activities involving 
  NASA astronauts. This included monitoring the development and implementation 
  of effective training programs to assure the flight readiness of available pilot/non-pilot 
  personnel for assignment to crew positions on manned space flights; furnishing 
  pilot evaluations applicable to the design, construction, and operations of 
  spacecraft systems and related equipment; and providing qualitative scientific 
  and engineering observations to facilitate overall mission planning, formulation 
  of feasible operational procedures, and selection and conduct of specific experiments 
  for each flight. He was restored to full flight status in May 1969, following 
  corrective surgery for an inner ear disorder.</p>

<p>Shepard made his second space flight as spacecraft commander on Apollo 14, January 
  31 - February 9, 1971. He was accompanied on man's third lunar landing mission 
  by Stuart A. Roosa, command module pilot, and Edgar D. Mitchell, lunar module 
  pilot. Maneuvering their lunar module, &quot;Antares,&quot; to a landing in 
  the hilly upland Fra Mauro region of the moon, Shepard and Mitchell subsequently 
  deployed and activated various scientific equipment and experiments and collected 
  almost 100 pounds of lunar samples for return to earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements 
  included: first use of Mobile Equipment Transporter (MET); largest payload placed 
  in lunar orbit; longest distance traversed on the lunar surface; largest payload 
  returned from the lunar surface; longest lunar surface stay time (33 hours); 
  longest lunar surface EVA (9 hours and 17 minutes); first use of shortened lunar 
  orbit rendezvous techniques; first use of colored TV with new vidicon tube on 
  lunar surface; and first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM 
  solo operations.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Shepard has logged a total of 216 hours and 57 minutes in space, 
  of which 9 hours and 17 minutes were spent in lunar surface EVA.</p>

<p>He resumed his duties as Chief of the Astronaut Office in June 1971 and served 
  in this capacity until he retired from NASA and the Navy on August 1, 1974.</p>

<p>Shepard was in private business in Houston, Texas. He served as the President 
  of the Mercury Seven Foundation, a non-profit organization which provides college 
  science scholarships for deserving students.</p>
