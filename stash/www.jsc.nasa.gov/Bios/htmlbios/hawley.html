<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Hawley attended the University of Kansas,  majoring in physics and astronomy. He  spent three summers employed as a research assistant: 1972 at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., and  1973 and 1974 at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. He attended graduate school at Lick  Observatory, University of California, Santa    Cruz. His  research involved spectrophotometry of gaseous nebulae and emission-line  galaxies with particular emphasis on chemical abundance determinations for  these objects. The results of his  research have been published in major astronomical journals. Prior to his selection by NASA in 1978,  Hawley was a post-doctoral research associate at Cerro Tololo Inter-American  Observatory in La Serena, Chile.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Hawley was selected as a NASA astronaut  in January 1978. Prior to STS-1, he served as a simulator pilot for software  checkout at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). For STS-2,  STS-3, and STS-4,  he was a member of the astronaut support crew at Kennedy Space Center, Florida,  for Orbiter test and checkout, and also served as prime close-out crewman for STS-3 and STS-4. During 1984-1985, he was Technical Assistant  to the Director, Flight Crew Operations.  From 1987-1990, he was the Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. In June 1990, he left the Astronaut Office to  assume the post of Associate Director of NASA&rsquo;s Ames  Research Center  in California. In August 1992, he returned to the Johnson Space Center  as Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations.  Dr. Hawley was returned to astronaut flight status in February  1996. He served on the  second Hubble Space Telescope mission and returned to duty as Deputy Director,  Flight Crew Operations. From  October 2001 to November 2002, Dr.  Hawley served as Director, Flight Crew Operations. From 2003 to 2004, Dr. Hawley also served as  the First Chief Astronaut for the NASA Engineering and Safety Center. From 2002 to 2008 he served as Director,  Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate. Dr. Hawley was responsible for directing a  scientific organization conducting research in planetary and space  science. The primary functions of the  organization included astromaterials acquisition and curation, astromaterials  research, and human exploration science.  A veteran of five space flights (STS-41D  in 1984, STS-61C in 1986, STS-31 in 1990, STS-82  in 1997 and STS-93 in 1999), Dr.  Hawley logged 32 days in space. Dr.  Hawley retired from NASA in May 2008.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE  FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Hawley has logged a total of 770 hours  and 27 minutes in five space flights. He  served as a mission specialist on STS-41D  in 1984, STS-61C in 1986, STS-31 in 1990, STS-82  in 1997 and STS-93 in 1999.</p>

<p>STS-41D Discovery (August 30 to September 5, 1984)  was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at  Edwards Air Force Base, California. This was the maiden flight of the Space  Shuttle Discovery. During the 7-day mission the crew  successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed the SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and TELSTAR 3-C satellites,  operated the CFES-III experiment,  the student crystal growth experiment, as well as photography experiments using  the IMAX motion picture  camera. The mission was completed in 96  orbits of the Earth in 144 hours and 57 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-61C Columbia (January 12-18,  1986) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a  night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 6-day flight the crew deployed the  SATCOM KU satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials  processing. Mission  duration was 146 hours and 03 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-31 Discovery  (April 24-29, 1990) was launched from the Kennedy  Space Center  in Florida, and also returned to land at  Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 5-day mission, the crew deployed  the Hubble Space Telescope, and conducted a variety of middeck experiments  involving the study of protein crystal growth, polymer membrane processing, and  the effects of weightlessness and magnetic fields on an ion arc. They also operated a variety of cameras,  including both the IMAX in-cabin  and cargo bay cameras, for Earth observations from their record-setting  altitude of 380 miles. The mission was  completed in 76 orbits of the earth in 121 hours.</p>

<p>STS-82 Discovery (February 11-21, 1997) the  second Hubble Space Telescope (HST) maintenance mission, was launched at night  and returned to a night landing at Kennedy    Space Center, Florida. During the flight, Dr. Hawley&rsquo;s primary role  was to operate the Shuttle&rsquo;s 50-foot robot arm to retrieve and redeploy the HST  following completion of upgrades and repairs.  Dr. Hawley also operated the robot arm during five space walks in which  two teams installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement  instruments. They also replaced insulation  patches over three compartments containing key data processing, electronics and  scientific instrument telemetry packages.  HST was then redeployed and boosted to a higher orbit. The flight was completed in 149 orbits  covering 3.8 million miles in 9 days, 23 hours, 37 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-93 Columbia (July 22-27, 1999) was  launched from the Kennedy   Space Center  on a 5-day mission returning to KSC for the 12th night landing in  the Shuttle Program&rsquo;s history. Dr.  Hawley served as Columbia&rsquo;s flight engineer. The primary mission objective was the  successful deployment of the Chandra X-ray  Observatory, the third of NASA&rsquo;s Great Observatories after Hubble Space  Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Dr. Hawley also served as the primary  operator of a second telescope carried in the crew module which was used for  several days to make broadband ultraviolet observations of a variety of solar  system objects. The mission completed 79  orbits in 4 days, 22 hours, and 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Dr.  Hawley is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kansas.</p>
