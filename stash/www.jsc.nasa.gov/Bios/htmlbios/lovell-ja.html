<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> During his Naval career he has had numerous 
  aviator assignments, including a 4-year tour as a test pilot at the Naval Air 
  Test Center, Patuxent River, Maryland.</p>

<p>While there he served as Program Manager for the F4H &quot;Phantom&quot; Fighter. 
  A graduate of the Aviation Safety School of the University of Southern California, 
  he also served as Safety Engineer with the Fighter Squadron 101 at the Naval 
  Air Station, Oceana, Virginia.</p>

<p>He has logged more than 7,000 hours flying time--more than 3,500 hours in jet 
  aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Captain Lovell was selected as an Astronaut 
  by NASA in September 1962. He has since served as backup pilot for the Gemini 
  4 flight and backup Commander for the Gemini 9 flight, as well as backup Commander 
  to Neil Armstrong for the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission.</p>

<p>On December 4, 1965, he and Frank Borman were launched into space on the history-making 
  Gemini 7 mission. The flight lasted 330 hours and 35 minutes and included the 
  first rendezvous of two manned maneuverable spacecraft.</p>

<p>The Gemini 12 mission, commanded by Lovell with Pilot Edwin Aldrin, began on 
  November 11, 1966. This 4-day, 59-revolution flight brought the Gemini program 
  to a successful close. Lovell served as Command Module Pilot and Navigator on 
  the epic six-day journey of Apollo 8 - man's maiden voyage to the moon - December 
  21-27, 1968. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to be lifted into near-earth 
  orbit by a 7-1/2 million pound thrust Saturn V launch vehicle; and Lovell and 
  fellow crewmen, Frank Borman and William A. Anders, became the first humans 
  to leave the Earth's gravitational influence.</p>

<p>He completed his fourth mission as Spacecraft Commander of the Apollo 13 flight, 
  April 11-17, 1970, and became the first man to journey twice to the moon. Apollo 
  13 was programmed for ten days. However, the original flight plan was modified 
  en route to the moon due to a failure of the Service Module cryogenic oxygen 
  system. Lovell and fellow crewmen, John L. Swigert and Fred W. Haise, working 
  closely with Houston ground controllers, converted their lunar module &quot;Aquarius&quot; 
  into an effective lifeboat. Their emergency activation and operation of lunar 
  module systems conserved both electrical power and water in sufficient supply 
  to assure their safety and survival while in space and for the return to earth.</p>

<p>Captain Lovell held the record for time in space with a total of 715 hours and 
  5 minutes until surpassed by the Skylab flights.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1973, Captain Lovell retired from the Navy and from the Space Program 
  to join Bay-Houston Towing Company in Houston, Texas. Bay-Houston Towing company 
  is a diversified company involved in harbor and coastwise towing, mining and 
  marketing of peat products for the lawn and garden industry, and ranching. He 
  was promoted to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer on March 
  1, 1975.</p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS BACKGROUND:</strong> On January 1, 1977, Captain Lovell 
  became President of Fisk Telephone Systems, Inc. in Houston, Texas (marketing 
  business communications equipment) in the southwestern United States. On January 
  1, 1981, he was appointed Group Vice President, Business Communications Systems, 
  a Centel Corporation. He retired from Centel Corp as Executive Vice President 
  and member of Board of Directors on January 1, 1991.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT:</strong> President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed 
  Captain Lovell as his consultant for Physical Fitness and Sports in June, 1967. 
  When the Physical Fitness Council was revised under President Nixon in 1970, 
  Captain Lovell was assigned the additional duty of Chairman of the Council. 
  After eleven years of performing his dual role with the Council, he relinquished 
  these positions in 1978. However, he is still a Consultant to the Council and 
  is presently assisting the Council in achieving its objective of making all 
  citizens aware of the importance of being physically fit. The office of the 
  President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports is located in Washington, 
  D.C.</p>

<p><strong>DIRECTORSHIPS:</strong> Federal Signal Corporation, Chicago Astronautics 
  Corp. of America, Milwaukee.</p>
