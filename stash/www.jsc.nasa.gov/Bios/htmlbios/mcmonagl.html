<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>DONALD R. McMONAGLE<br />
MANAGER, LAUNCH INTEGRATION<br />
SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM<br />
JOHN F. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLORIDA</strong></p>

<p>Donald R. McMonagle (Retired Colonel, USAF) became the Manager, Launch Integration,at 
  the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, effective August 15, 1997. In this capacity 
  he is responsible for final Shuttle preparation, launch execution, and return 
  of the orbiter to KSC following landings at any location other than KSC. He 
  is chair of the Mission Management Team, and is the final authority for launch decision.</p>

<p>McMonagle was born on May 14, 1952, in Flint, Michigan, and graduated from 
  Hamady High School, Flint, Michigan, in 1970. McMonagle received a Bachelor 
  of Science degree in Astronautical Engineering from the United States Air Force 
  Academy in 1974 and a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from 
  California State University-Fresno in 1985.</p>

<p>McMonagle completed pilot training at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB), Mississippi, 
  in 1975. After F-4 training at Homestead AFB, Florida, he went on a 1-year tour 
  of duty as an F-4 pilot at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. He returned from overseas 
  to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, in 1977. In 1979, McMonagle was assigned to Luke 
  AFB, Arizona, as an F-15 instructor pilot. In 1981, he entered the USAF Test 
  Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, and was the outstanding graduate in 
  his class. From 1982 to 1985, McMonagle was the operations officer and a project 
  test pilot for the Advanced Fighter Technology Integration F-16 aircraft. After 
  attending the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, from 1985 
  to 1986, he was assigned as the operations officer of the 6513th Test Squadron 
  at Edwards AFB. McMonagle has over 5,000 hours of flying experience in a variety 
  of aircraft, primarily the T-38, F- 4, F-15, and F-16.</p>

<p>McMonagle was selected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1987. A veteran of 
  three space flights, McMonagle has logged over 605 hours in space. McMonagle 
  flew as a mission specialist aboard the Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i> on Department 
  of Defense mission STS-39 in April 1991. During this highly successful 8-day 
  mission, the seven-man crew deployed, operated, and retrieved a remotely-controlled 
  spacecraft and conducted several science experiments to include research of 
  both natural and induced phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere. In January 1993, 
  McMonagle served as pilot on STS-54 aboard the Space Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i>. 
  The 6-day mission featured the deployment of a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite 
  (TDRS), and the collection of information about celestial x-rays using a Diffuse 
  X-Ray Spectrometer. McMonagle commanded a crew of six aboard Space Shuttle <i>Atlantis</i> 
  on the STS-66 Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) 
  11-day mission in November 1994. In January 1996 McMonagle was assigned the 
  task to establish a new Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) Project Office responsible 
  for managing all NASA resources associated with space suits and tools used to 
  conduct space walks in support of Space Shuttle and the International Space 
  Station. This role included responsibility for developing and implementing a 
  plan for research and development of next generation space suits to support 
  future human space exploration.</p>

<p>McMonagle's accomplishments have earned him many notable awards. He has received 
  the Air Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, three Air Force Commendation Medals, 
  the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Liethen-Tittle 
  Award (Top Graduate from USAF Test Pilot School), three NASA Space Flight Medals, 
  the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal.</p>

<p>McMonagle is a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots; Association of Graduates, U. S. Air Force Academy; and Association of Space Explorers.</p>

<p>McMonagle is married to the former Janyce Morton of Phoenix, Arizona. They have two children and reside in Merritt Island, Florida.</p>
