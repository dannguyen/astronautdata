<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Williams was selected for the NASA Astronaut Class of 1996. In addition to his space flights, he has performed various technical duties in both the space shuttle and International Space Station Programs. Williams has served in the Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), Space Station, and Soyuz Branches of the Astronaut Office, led the development of a space shuttle cockpit upgrade, and completed temporary assignments at Marshall Space Flight Center supporting the test and evaluation of the International Space Station Laboratory Module and at NASA Headquarters in support of legislative affairs. In July 2002, Williams commanded a nine-day coral reef expedition operating from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Aquarius undersea habitat off the coast of Florida. Williams has also served on the space station backup flight crews for Expeditions 12, 19, and 20.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Williams served as the flight engineer and lead space walker for space shuttle flight STS-101. STS-101 Atlantis (May 19 through May 29, 2000) was the third shuttle mission devoted to space station construction. Objectives for the 10-day flight included transporting and installing over 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, and included Williams’ first EVA lasting nearly 7 hours.</p>

<p>In 2006, Williams served as flight engineer for Expedition 13, launching on March 29 on the Russian Soyuz TMA-8 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan and docking with the station on March 31. During the six-month tour of duty aboard the International Space Station, Williams performed two successful space walks (one Russia and one USA) logging an additional 12 hours and 25 minutes of EVA, and also saw the arrival of two space shuttle missions, the resumption of construction of the orbiting laboratory, and the restoration of a three-person expedition crew. The Expedition 13 mission concluded on September 28 with a safe landing in central Kazakhstan.</p>
