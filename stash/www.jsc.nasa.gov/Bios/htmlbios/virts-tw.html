    <p><strong>EXPERIENCE: </strong> Virts attended the Ecole de l’Air (French
      Air Force Academy) in 1988 on an exchange program from the United States
      Air Force Academy.  He received his commission as a Second Lieutenant upon
      graduation from the United States Air Force Academy in 1989.  He earned
      his pilot wings from Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, in 1990.  From
      there, Virts completed basic fighter and F-16 training and was assigned to
      Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, as an operational F-16 pilot in the
      307th Tactical Fighter Squadron.  After Hurricane Andrew struck Homestead
      in 1992, his squadron was moved to Moody Air Force Base, Georgia.  From
      1993 to 1994, he served in the 36th Fighter Squadron at Osan Air Base,
      Republic of Korea, where he flew low-altitude night attack missions in the
      F-16.  Following his tour in Korea, he was reassigned to the 22nd Fighter
      Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, from 1995 to 1998.  There, he
      flew the suppression of enemy air defenses missions, logging 45 combat
      missions in the F-16.  Virts was a member of the United States Air Force
      Test Pilot School class 98B at Edwards Air Force Base, California. 
      Following graduation, he was an Experimental Test Pilot at the F-16
      Combined Test Force at Edwards from 1999 until his selection as a member
      of the 18th group of astronaut candidates in 2000. While at Edwards he
      served as the chief test pilot for the F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) as
      well as the Multi-Mission Computer (MMC) programs, the largest upgrade
      program in the 40-year history of the F-16.</p>
    <p>He has logged over 4,300 flight hours in more than 40 different aircraft.<strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Selected as a pilot by NASA in July
      2000, Virts reported for training in August 2000.  His technical
      assignments to date have included Lead Astronaut for the T-38 program,
      Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) test crew member,
      Expedition 9 Crew Support Astronaut and lead astronaut for appearances. 
      He has worked as a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) from Expedition 8 to 19
      as well as STS-115 to STS-126, communicating with station and shuttle
      crews from Mission Control in Houston.  He also served as the lead Ascent
      and Entry CAPCOM, Chief of the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch and lead
      astronaut for the Space Launch System heavy lift booster.</p>
    <p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE</strong> STS-130 pilot, Endeavour
      (February 8 to February 21, 2010), carrying aloft the International Space
      Station’s final permanent modules: Tranquility and Cupola.  Tranquility
      (or Node 3) is now the life-support hub of the space station, containing
      exercise, water recycling and environmental control systems, while the
      Cupola provides the largest set of windows ever flown in space.  These
      seven windows, which are arranged in a hemisphere, provide a spectacular
      and panoramic view of our planet and afford crews a direct view of station
      robotic operations.  </p>
    <p align="center">As pilot, Virts was responsible for assisting Commander
      George Zamka during launch, landing, rendezvous and orbital maneuvering. 
      He was also the mission’s lead robotic operator and was responsible for
      much of the internal outfitting of Tranquility and Cupola.  During the
      13-day, 18-hour mission, Endeavour traveled more than 5.7 million miles
      and completed 217 orbits of the Earth.</p>
    <p>Virts is currently assigned to Expedition 42/43, as commander for
      Expedition 43, which is scheduled to launch on a Russian Soyuz in December
      2014, with a planned landing in May 2015.</p>
