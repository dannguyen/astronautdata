<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Before joining the space program, Ms. Payette conducted research in computer systems, natural language processing and automatic speech recognition.  She worked as a system engineer with IBM Canada (1986 to 1988); research assistant at the University of Toronto (1988 to1990); visiting scientist at the IBM Research Laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland (1991), and research engineer with BNR/Nortel in Montr&eacute;al (1992).</p>

<p>In June 1992, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) selected Ms. Payette from 5,330 applicants to become one of four astronauts.  After her basic training in Canada, she worked as a technical advisor for the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), an advanced robotics system contributed by Canada to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>In preparation for a space mission assignment, Ms. Payette obtained her commercial pilot license, studied Russian and logged 120 hours as a research operator onboard reduced gravity aircraft.  In April 1996, Ms. Payette was certified as a one-atmosphere, deep-sea diving suit operator.  Ms. Payette obtained her military pilot captaincy on the Tutor CT-114 "Snowbird" jet at the Canadian Air Force Base in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in February 1996.  She obtained her military instrument rating in 1997.  She has logged more than 1,300 hours of flight time.</p>

<p>Ms. Payette was  Chief Astronaut for the Canadian Space Agency (2000-2007).</p>

<p>In January 2011, Ms. Payette undertook a research fellowship as a Public Policy Scholar at the prestigious Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, D.C.  In October 2011, Ms. Payette accepted an appointment as Scientific Delegate to the United States for the Quebec Government.  She is based in Washington, D.C., and remains a member of the Canadian astronaut corps.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Ms. Payette reported to NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in August 1996.  She completed initial astronaut training in April 1998 and was assigned to work on technical issues in robotics for the Astronaut Office.  A veteran of two spaceflights, STS-96 (1999) and STS-127 (2009), she has logged more than 611 hours in space.</p>

<p>From September 1999 to December 2002, Ms Payette was assigned to represent the astronaut corps at the European and Russian space agencies, where she supervised procedure development, equipment verification and space hardware processing for the International Space Station Program.</p>

<p>Ms. Payette also served as a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) at Mission Control Center in Houston and was lead CAPCOM for space shuttle mission <a href="http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/missions/sts-121/default.asp" title="http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/missions/sts-121/default.asp">STS-121</a>. The CAPCOM is responsible for all communications between ground controllers and the astronauts in flight.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Ms. Payette flew on space shuttle Discovery from May 27 to June 6, 1999, as a crew member of STS-96.  During the mission, the crew members performed the first manual docking of the shuttle to the International Space Station and delivered four tons of supplies to the station.  Ms. Payette served as a Mission Specialist, was responsible for the station systems, supervised the spacewalk and operated the Canadarm robotic arm.  The STS-96 mission was accomplished in 153 orbits of the Earth, traveling more than six million kilometers in nine days, 19 hours and 13 minutes.  Ms. Payette was the first Canadian to participate in an ISS assembly mission and to board the station.</p>

<p>From July 15 to July 31, 2009, Ms. Payette served as the Flight Engineer on the crew of STS-127 aboard space shuttle Endeavour on the 29th shuttle mission to the International Space Station.  During this mission, also known as station assembly mission 2J/A, the crew completed the construction of the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module, installed scientific experiments on its exposed facility and delivered critical spare parts and replacement batteries to the orbital complex.  Robotics technology was used almost every day on this assembly mission, and Ms. Payette operated all three robotic arms:  the shuttle's Canadarm, the station's Canadarm2 and a special-purpose Japanese arm on Kibo. While the shuttle was docked to the ISS, the mission featured a record 13 astronauts from 5 different nationalities together onboard a single joint spacecraft.  It also highlighted the first time that two Canadians were in space at the same time. The 16-day mission included five spacewalks and traveled 10.5 million kilometers in 248 orbits around the Earth.</p>
