<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>RONALD E. MCNAIR (PH.D.)<br />
NASA ASTRONAUT (DECEASED)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born October 21, 1950, in Lake City, 
  South Carolina. Died January 28, 1986. He is survived by his wife Cheryl, and 
  two children. He was a 5th degree black belt Karate instructor and a performing 
  jazz saxophonist. He also enjoyed running, boxing, football, playing cards, and cooking.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Carver High School, Lake 
  City, South Carolina, in 1967; received a bachelor of science degree in Physics 
  from North Carolina A&amp;T State University in 1971 and a doctor of philosophy 
  in Physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976; presented an 
  honorary doctorate of Laws from North Carolina A&amp;T State University in 1978, 
  an honorary doctorate of Science from Morris College in 1980, and an honorary 
  doctorate of science from the University of South Carolina in 1984.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member of the American Association for 
  the Advancement of Science, the American Optical Society, the American Physical 
  Society (APS), the APS Committee on Minorities in Physics, the North Carolina 
  School of Science and Mathematics Board of Trustees, the MIT Corporation Visiting 
  Committee, Omega Psi Phi, and a visiting lecturer in Physics at Texas Southern University.</p>

<p><strong>AWARDS:</strong> Posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Graduated magna cum laude from North 
  Carolina A&amp;T (1971); named a Presidential Scholar (1967-1971), a Ford Foundation 
  Fellow (1971-1974), a National Fellowship Fund Fellow (1974-1975), a NATO Fellow 
  (1975); winner of Omega Psi Phi Scholar of the Year Award (1975), Los Angeles 
  Public School Systems Service Commendation (1979), Distinguished Alumni Award 
  (1979), National Society of Black Professional Engineers Distinguished National 
  Scientist Award (1979), Friend of Freedom Award (1981), Whos Who Among Black 
  Americans (1980), an AAU Karate Gold Medal (1976), five Regional Blackbelt Karate 
  Championships, and numerous proclamations and achievement awards.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> While at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
  Dr. McNair performed some of the earliest development of chemical HF/DF and 
  high-pressure CO lasers. His later experiments and theoretical analysis on the 
  interaction of intense CO<sustrong>2</sustrong> laser radiation with molecular gases provided 
  new understandings and applications for highly excited polyatomic molecules.</p>

<p>In 1975, he studied laser physics with many authorities in 
  the field at Ecole Dete Theorique de Physique, Les Houches, France. He published 
  several papers in the areas of lasers and molecular spectroscopy and gave many 
  presentations in the United States and abroad.</p>

<p>Following graduation from MIT in 1976, he became a staff physicist 
  with Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California. His assignments included 
  the development of lasers for isotope separation and photochemistry utilizing 
  non-linear interactions in low-temperature liquids and optical pumping techniques. 
  He also conducted research on electro-optic laser modulation for satellite-to-satellite 
  space communications, the construction of ultra-fast infrared detectors, ultraviolet 
  atmospheric remote sensing, and the scientific foundations of the martial arts.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Selected as an astronaut candidate 
  by NASA in January 1978, he completed a 1-year training and evaluation period 
  in August 1979, qualifying him for assignment as a mission specialist astronaut 
  on Space Shuttle flight crews.</p>

<p>He first flew as a mission specialist on STS 41-B which launched 
  from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 3, 1984. The crew included spacecraft 
  commander, Mr. Vance Brand, the pilot, Commander Robert L. Gibson, and fellow 
  mission specialists, Captain Bruce McCandless II, and Lt. Col. Robert L. Stewart. 
  The flight accomplished the proper shuttle deployment of two Hughes 376 communications 
  satellites, as well as the flight testing of rendezvous sensors and computer 
  programs. This mission marked the first flight of the Manned Maneuvering Unit 
  and the first use of the Canadian arm (operated by McNair) to position EVA crewman 
  around <i>Challenger</i>s payload bay. Included were the German SPAS-01 Satellite, 
  acoustic levitation and chemical separation experiments, the Cinema 360 motion 
  picture filming, five Getaway Specials, and numerous mid-deck experiments -- 
  all of which Dr. McNair assumed primary responsibility. <i>Challenger</i> culminated 
  in the first landing on the runway at Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1984. 
  With the completion of this flight, he logged a total of 191 hours in space.</p>

<p>Dr. McNair was assigned as a mission specialist on STS 51-L. 
  Dr. McNair died on January 28, 1986 when the Space Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> 
  exploded after launch from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, also taking the 
  lives of the spacecraft commander, Mr. F.R. Scobee, the pilot, Commander M.J. 
  Smith (USN), mission specialists, Lieutenant Colonel E.S. Onizuka (USAF), and 
  Dr. J.A. Resnik, and two civilian payload specialists, Mr. G.B. Jarvis and Mrs. 
  S. C. McAuliffe.</p>
