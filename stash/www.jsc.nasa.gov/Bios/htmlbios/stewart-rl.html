  3-11, 1984) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to 
  land there 8-days later. During the mission, Stewart and McCandless participated 
  in two extravehicular activities (EVA's) to conduct first flight evaluations 
  of the Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU's). These EVA's represented man's first 
  untethered operations from a spacecraft in flight.</p>

<p>STS-51J <i>Atlantis</i> (October 3-7, 1985) was launched from Kennedy Space 
  Center, Florida, and after 98 hours of orbital operations returned to land at
