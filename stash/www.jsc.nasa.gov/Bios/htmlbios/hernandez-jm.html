M.S.,  Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, University of California-Santa Barbara, 1986.</p>
<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong>   Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), Society of  Mexican American Engineers and Scientists (MAES).</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong>   Ph.D. Science, University  of the Pacific (honoris causa), 2006. NASA  Service Awards (2002, 2003), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  “Outstanding Engineer Award” (2001), Upward Bound National TRIO Achiever Award  (2001), U.S. Department of Energy “Outstanding Performance Commendation”  (2000), Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists (MAES) “Medalla de  Oro” recipient for professional and community contributions (1999), Hispanic  Engineer National Achievement Award, “Outstanding Technical Contribution”  (1995), Graduate Engineering Minority Fellow (GEM)  (1985), and Eta Kappa Nu Electrical Engineering Honor Society member. </p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>   1987-2001 were spent at the Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory,<strong> </strong>Livermore, California.</p>
<p><em>1987-1991</em>  <em>Electronics  Engineer, Material Analysis Group.  </em>Refined  signal and image processing skills for applications in radar imaging, computed  tomography, acoustic imaging and other non-destructive evaluation techniques.</p>
<p><em>1991-1994  </em><em>Electronics  Engineer, Chemistry and Material Science Group.  </em>Developed  quantitative x-ray film imaging analysis techniques that allowed the  characterization of low-density materials for use in the development of an  X-Ray laser as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative Program.  Developed material x-ray transport models  that allowed for the development of human tissue absorbed dose models useful  for medical imaging applications.</p>
<p><em>1994-1996  </em><em>Group  Leader, Chemistry and Material Science Group.  </em>Managed  the career development of twenty-nine professional technical staff members who  supported chemistry and materials science research activities.  Identified and developed the Group’s  programmatic research support opportunities.   Carried out own research activities as a principal investigator in the  area of x-ray physics and image processing.</p>
<p><em>1996-1999  </em><em>Deputy Program  Manager, Highly Enriched Uranium Implementation Program.  </em>Responsible for the implementation of a  signed bilateral agreement between the U.S.  and Russian Federation for  the U.S.  purchase of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the form of low enriched uranium  (LEU) derived from the dismantlement of Russian nuclear weapons.  Responsibilities included utilizing national  laboratory resources for the purpose of ensuring the U.S. government that the LEU  purchased was derived from dismantled nuclear weapons.  This was accomplished by developing technical  training modules for U.S.  multi-lab and multi-agency experts, which allowed them to visit Russian  facilities and effectively perform inspections in accordance to U.S.-Russian  signed agreements, protocols and annexes.   Fiscal planning responsibilities for the $16 Million multi-lab  implementation budget and direct oversight of the $6 million annual budget for  the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory component.</p>
<p><em>1999-2001  </em><em>Program  Manager, Office of International Material Protection and Emergency  Cooperation.  </em>On a two-year change-of-station assignment at the U.S. Department of  Energy, Washington, D.C.  Managed the  integration and allocation of Department of Energy assets and expertise,  including the national laboratories and contractors, in planning, directing,  and implementing U.S. cooperation with the Russian Federation in the program  of Nuclear Materials, Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&amp;A).  Developed and implemented policies,  strategies and plans and objectives to enhance U.S. national security and reduce  threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.  These goals were accomplished by rapidly  improving the security of large quantities of attractive, weapons-usable  nuclear material at the closed Ministry of Atomic Energy (MinAtom) cities that  compromise Russia’s  nuclear weapons complex. Proposed, defended and executed annual budget of over  $14 million to support extensive engineering, technical safety, security, and  environmental research and policy development with regard to MPC&amp;A at three  of the seven MinAtom sites.</p>
<p><em>Feb 11-Present  Executive Director for Strategic Operations</em> at MEI  Technologies, Inc. (MEIT) located in Houston, TX.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  </p>
<p>In 2001,  Hernandez joined the Johnson Space Center,  in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>During his NASA  career, Hernandez had the following duties:</p>
<p><em>Mar 01-Jan 02</em>  <em>Materials  Research Engineer, Materials  &amp;  Processes Branch.  </em>Developed,  evaluated, and selected advanced structural materials to aircraft and  spacecraft structures and their power and propulsion systems. Conducted  research in basic engineering materials and apply general engineering mechanics  principles to define material behavior. Designed and fielded radiation effects  experiments for electronic hardware. Served as the Engineering Directorate's liaison  on the electrical wire integrity interagency working group.</p>
<p>Jan 02-Jun 04   Branch Chief, Materials, &amp; Processes Branch.  Materials and  Processes (M&amp;P) branch chief within the Structural Engineering Division.  Duties included managing the careers of 30 professional civil servants with  diverse set of skills in materials science. Also serve as the overall technical  monitor of contractor support that included more than 20 contractors.  Responsible for the oversight of the branch’s activities in the areas of materials  and processes, fracture control, non destructive evaluation, failure analysis,  and nano materials research. More specifically, managed branch resources to  address materials usage issues with respect to flammability, toxicity,  contamination, space environment compatibility, and corrosion. Materials  testing and fracture control analysis of flight and non-flight hardware were  also significant activities within the branch. Served as the project lead for  the development of a space qualified bore scope for future on-orbit EVA  inspection applications.</p>
<p><em>May 2004</em>   Selected by NASA as an Astronaut Candidate.  In February 2006, he completed Astronaut  Candidate Training that included scientific and technical briefings, intensive  instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological  training, T-38 flight training, and water and wilderness survival  training.  Hernandez was assigned to the  Astronaut Office Shuttle Branch supporting Shuttle launch and landing  preparations at Kennedy Space Center.  He also trained as Mission Control Capsule  Communicator.  In 2010, he was on detail  at NASA Headquarters’ Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental affairs.   </p>
<p>He departed NASA  in January 2011.</p>
<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-128 Discovery (August 28 to September 11,  2009) was the 128th Shuttle mission and the 30th mission to the  International Space Station.  While at  the orbital outpost, the STS-128 crew rotated an expedition crewmember,  attached the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), and transferred  over 18,000 pounds of supplies and equipment to the station.  The STS-128 crew conducted three  spacewalks.  The STS-128 mission was  accomplished in 217 orbits of the Earth, traveling over 5.7 million miles in  332 hours and 53 minutes and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base,  California.</p>
