  </p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Phillips was selected by NASA and began astronaut candidate training in 1996.  He has held various jobs in the Astronaut Office, including systems engineering and CAPCOM for the International Space Station (ISS) and as a robotics specialist, supporting operations on missions.  Phillips has logged more than 203 days in space during three flights and has flown as Flight Engineer on three different spacecraft types:  shuttle, Soyuz and ISS.  Phillips was detailed to the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA, from 2009 to 2011 as the Smith/McCool NASA Chair Professor.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-100 <em>Endeavour</em> (April 19 to May 1, 2001).  During the 12-day, 187 orbit mission, the crew successfully delivered and installed the Canadarm-2 robotic arm.  They also delivered experiments and supplies aboard the Multi‑Purpose Logistics Module, “<em>Raffaello”</em>on its maiden flight.  Phillips was the Ascent/Entry Flight Engineer and was the Intravehicular Activity Coordinator during two spacewalks. <br />
</p>
<p>ISS Expedition 11 (April 15 to October 10, 2005).  Phillips launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard Soyuz TMA-6 and served as NASA Science Officer and Flight Engineer aboard ISS.  During their 6-month stay aboard ISS, the crew continued ISS maintenance, worked with scientific experiments, performed a spacewalk in Russian spacesuits from the Pirs Airlock and hosted the “return to flight” visit of Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-114).  The ISS-11 crew landed in Kazakhstan on October&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2005.  In completing his second mission, Phillips logged 179 days and 23 minutes in space, including an EVA totaling 4 hours and 58 minutes.<br />
