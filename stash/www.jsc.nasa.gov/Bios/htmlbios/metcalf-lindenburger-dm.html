<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Five years of teaching Earth Science and Astronomy at Hudson&rsquo;s Bay High School  in Vancouver, Washington.  Three years of  coaching cross-country running at the high-school level and two years of  coaching Science Olympiad.  Undergraduate  research with the KECK Consortium for two summers:  Mapping the last glaciations of Russell Creek  in Wyoming (1995) and mapping and determining the petrology of the rocks in the  Wet Mountain region of Colorado (1996).   Both research positions led to publications.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:  </strong> Metcalf-Lindenburger  was selected by NASA as a Mission Specialist  in May 2004.  In February 2006, she  completed Astronaut Candidate Training, which included scientific and technical  briefings, intensive instruction in shuttle and International Space Station  systems, physiological training, T-38 flight training and water and wilderness  survival training.  Completion of this  initial training qualified her for technical assignments within the Astronaut  Office and future flight assignment.   Metcalf-Lindenburger served as the Astronaut Office Station Branch twig  lead for systems and crew interfaces.  In  2010, she was a mission specialist on the crew of STS-131 and logged more than  362 hours in space.  After her space  flight, she worked as a Cape Crusader for the final three shuttle missions. She  also supported the Astronaut Office Station Operation Branch as a lead for the  provisions, manifests, and stowage twig. </p>
<p>In June 2012,  Metcalf-Lindenburger commanded the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations  (NEEMO) 16. &nbsp;In this underwater habitat, the international crew of four  aquanauts and two habitat technicians carried out simulated spacewalks to  investigate the techniques and tools that may be used at a Near Earth Asteroid  (NEA). &nbsp;Additionally, they operated under a 50-second, one‑way  communication delay and conducted educational and public live video  appearances.</p>
<p>Metcalf-Lindenburger  retired from NASA on June 13, 2014, to live and work in the Seattle area.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:  </strong>STS-131 Discovery (April 5 to April 20,  2010), a resupply mission to the International Space Station, was launched at  night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.   On arrival at the station, Discovery&rsquo;s crew dropped off more than 27,000  pounds of hardware, supplies and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia  coolant that required three spacewalks to hook up, new crew sleeping quarters  and three experiment racks.  On the  return journey, Leonardo, the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) inside  Discovery&rsquo;s payload bay, was packed with more than 6,000 pounds of hardware,  science results and trash.   The STS-131  mission was accomplished in 15 days, 02 hours, 47 minutes and 10 seconds and  traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 Earth orbits.</p>
