<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Captain Schirra
    was one of the seven Mercury Astronauts named by NASA in April 1959. On October 3, 1962; he piloted the six orbit Sigma
    7 Mercury flight; a flight which lasted 9 hours, 15 minutes. The spacecraft attained a velocity of 17,557 miles per hour
    at an altitude of 175 statue miles and traveled almost 144,000 statute miles before re-entry into the earth's atmosphere.
  Recovery of the Sigma 7 spacecraft occurred in the Pacific Ocean about 275 miles northeast of Midway Island.</p>

<p>Schirra
  next served as backup command pilot for the Gemini III Mission and on December 15-16, occupied the Command Pilot seat on
  the history-making Gemini 6 flight. The highlight of this mission was a successful rendezvous of Gemini 6 with the already
  orbiting Gemini 7 spacecraft, thus, accomplishing the first rendezvous of two manned maneuverable spacecraft and establishing
  another space first for the United States. Known as a &ldquo;text book&rdquo; pilot, Schirra remained
  in the spacecraft following his Mercury and Gemini flight and is the first Astronaut to be brought aboard recovery ships
  twice in this manner. With him on Gemini 6, was Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford.</p>

<p>He was the Command Pilot on Apollo VII, the
    first manned flight test of the three direction United States spacecraft. Apollo VII began on October 11, 1968, with
  Command Module Pilot Donn F. Eisele and Lunar Module Pilot Walter Cunningham. Schirra participated in, and executed, maneuvers
    enabling crew members to perform exercises in transposition and docking and orbit rendezvous with the S-IVB stage from
    the Saturn IB launch vehicle. The mission completed eight successful tests and maneuvering ignitions of the service module
    propulsion engine, measured the accuracy of performance of all spacecraft systems, and provided the first effective television
    transmission of on-board crew activities. Apollo VII was placed in an orbit with an apogee of 153.5 nautical miles and
  a perigee of 122.6 nautical miles.</p>

<p>The 260 hour 4.5 million mile shake down flight was concluded on October 22, with splashdown
    occurring in the Atlantic some 8 miles from the carrier Essex (only 3/10 of a mile from the originally predicted aiming
    point). Captain Schirra has logged a total of 295 hours and 15 minutes in space. He is unique in that he is the only
  Astronaut to have flown Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.</p>
