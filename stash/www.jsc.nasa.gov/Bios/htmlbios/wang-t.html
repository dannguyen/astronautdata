<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Taylor G. Wang<br />
  Payload Specialist</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born June 16, 1940, in Mainland China. 
  He is a Physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, and is a U.S. 
  citizen. He is married, and has two sons.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Received a bachelor of science degree in physics 
  in 1967, a master of science degree in physics in 1968, and a doctorate in physics 
  in 1971, from the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> Member, American Physical Society, Materials 
  Research Society, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Sigma 
  Xi, and a Fellow in the Acoustical Society of America.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> After completing his doctorate, Dr. Wang 
  joined the California Institute of Technology Jet propulsion Laboratory (JPL) 
  in 1972, as a senior scientist. He is currently Program Manager for Materials 
  Processing in Space. At JPL he was responsible for the inception and development 
  of containerless processing science and technology research. He is the Principal 
  Investigator (PI) on the Spacelab 3 mission NASA Drop Dynamics (DDM) experiments, 
  PI on the NASA SPAR Flight Experiment #77-18 &quot;Dynamics of Liquid Bubble,&quot; 
  PI on the NASA SPAR Flight Experiment #76-20 &quot;Containerless Processing 
  Technology,&quot; and PI on the Department of Energy Experiment &quot;Spherical 
  Shell Technology.&quot; Dr. Wang has been conducting precursor drop dynamics 
  experiments for the DDM in ground-based laboratories employing acoustic levitation 
  systems, neutral buoyancy systems and drop towers, and in the near weightless 
  environment provided by JSC's KC-135 airplane flights and SPAR rockets. These 
  flights have helped to define the experimental parameters and procedures in 
  the DDM experiments to be performed on Spacelab 3. He is the inventor of the 
  acoustic levitation and manipulation chamber for the DDM and is the author of 
  70 articles in open literature and 20 U.S. patents.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Dr. Wang flew on STS-51B <i>Challenger</i> 
  (April 29-May 6, 1985). STS-51B/Spacelab-3 was launched from Kennedy Space Center, 
  Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was 
  the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard <i>Challenger</i> 
  conducted investigations in crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless 
  material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary 
  atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, laboratory animals and human medical monitoring. 
  At mission conclusion, Dr. Wang had traveled over 2.9 million miles in 110 Earth 
  orbits, and had logged over 168 hours in space.</p>
