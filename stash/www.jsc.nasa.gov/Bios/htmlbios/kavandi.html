<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Janet Lynn Kavandi (Ph.D.)<br />
DIRECTOR, FLIGHT CREW OPERATIONS, JOHNSON SPACE CENTER</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL  DATA:</strong>  Born in Springfield,   Missouri.  Married to John Kavandi.  They have two children.  She enjoys snow skiing, hiking, camping,  horseback riding, windsurfing, flying, scuba diving, piano.  Her parents, William and Ruth Sellers of  Cassville, Missouri,  are deceased.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>EDUCATION:  </strong>Graduated from Carthage  Senior High School, Carthage  Missouri, in 1977;  received a Bachelor of Science Degree in  Chemistry from Missouri Southern State College - Joplin in 1980; Master of  Science Degree in Chemistry from the University  of Missouri - Rolla in 1982;  Doctorate in Analytical Chemistry from the University of Washington  - Seattle in  1990.</p>
<p> <strong>SPECIAL HONORS:  </strong>Elected to the National Honor Society,  1977.  Valedictorian of Carthage Senior High School,  1977.  Awarded Presidential Scholarship  from Missouri Southern State University,  1977.  Graduated Magma Cum Laude from Missouri Southern State University,  1980.  Awarded certificates for Team  Excellence and Performance Excellence from Boeing Missile Systems, 1991.  Recipient of three NASA Space Flight Medals  for shuttle flights STS-91, STS-99, and STS-104.   Presented the NASA Exceptional Service  Medal, 2001 and 2002.  Presented the NASA  Outstanding Leadership Medal, 2006.</p>
<p> <strong>EXPERIENCE:  </strong>Following graduation in 1982, Dr.  Kavandi accepted a position at Eagle-Picher Industries in Joplin, Missouri,  as an engineer in new battery development for defense applications.  In 1984, she accepted a position as an  engineer in the Power Systems Technology Department of the Boeing Aerospace  Company in Seattle, Washington.   She served as lead engineer of secondary power for the Short Range  Attack Missile II, and principal technical staff representative involved in the  design and development of thermal batteries for Sea Lance and the Lightweight  Exo-Atmospheric Projectile.  Other  programs she supported include Space Station, Lunar and Mars Base studies,  Inertial Upper Stage, Advanced Orbital Transfer Vehicle, Get-Away Specials, Air  Launched Cruise Missile, Minuteman, and Peacekeeper.  In 1986, while still working for Boeing, she  was accepted into graduate school at the University of Washington,  where she began working toward her doctorate in analytical chemistry.  Her doctoral dissertation involved the  development of a pressure-indicating coating that uses oxygen quenching of  porphyrin photoluminescence to provide continuous surface pressure maps of  aerodynamic test models in wind tunnels.   Her work on pressure indicating paints has resulted in two patents.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:  </strong>Dr.  Kavandi was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994 and  reported to the Johnson   Space Center  in March 1995.  Following an initial year  of training, she was assigned to the Payloads and Habitability Branch where she  supported payload integration for the International Space Station.  Dr. Kavandi served as a mission specialist on  STS-91 (June 2-12, 1998), the  ninth and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian  Phase 1 program.  Following the mission,  she worked as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in NASA&rsquo;s Mission Control   Center.  On her second mission, she served aboard STS-99 (February 11-22, 2000), the Shuttle Radar  Topography Mission, which mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth&rsquo;s land  surface to provide data for a highly accurate three-dimensional topographical  map.  Dr. Kavandi subsequently worked in  the Robotics Branch, where she trained on both the shuttle and space station  robotic manipulator systems.  On her most  recent mission, she served aboard STS-104/ISS  Assembly Flight 7A (July 12-24, 2001) on the tenth mission to the International  Space Station.  The shuttle crew  installed the joint airlock &ldquo;Quest&rdquo; and conducted joint operations with the  Expedition-2 crew.   Following her last  mission, Dr. Kavandi again served as lead for the Payloads and Habitability  Branch, then as the branch chief for the International Space Station  (ISS).  She was responsible for the  training, operations, safety, and habitability of crews onboard the ISS, as  well as the hardware and software development and design reviews.  She was also responsible for the scientific  payloads that the ISS crews operate on orbit and for coordination between  international partners for visiting vehicles and associated operations.  In 2005, she accepted the post of Deputy  Chief of the Astronaut Office.  In 2008,  she became Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations, Johnson  Space  Center.  Dr. Kavandi currently serves as  Director, Flight Crew Operations, responsible for directing the day-to-day  activities of the directorate, including the Astronaut Corps and aircraft  operations at Ellington Field.  </p>
<p> A three-flight veteran, Dr.  Kavandi has logged more than 33 days in space, traveling more than 13.1 million  miles in 535 Earth orbits.</p>
