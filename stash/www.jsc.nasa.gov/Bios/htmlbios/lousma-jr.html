<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Lousma was a reconnaissance pilot with VMCJ-2, 
  2nd Marine Air Wing, at Cherry Point, North Carolina, before being assigned 
  to Houston and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. He became a Marine Corps 
  officer in 1959 and received his wings in 1960 after completing training at 
  the U.S. Naval Air Training Command. He was then assigned to VMA-224, 2nd Marine 
  Air Wing, as an attack pilot and later served with VMA-224, 1st Marine Air Wing, 
  at Iwakuni, Japan. He has logged 7000 hours of flight time--including 700 hours 
  in general aviation aircraft and 1619 hours in space, 4,500 hours in jet aircraft, 
  240 hours in helicopters, and 700 hours in general aviation aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Lousma is one of the 19 astronauts selected 
  by NASA in April 1966. He served as a member of the astronaut support crews 
  for the Apollo 9, 10, and 13 missions. He was the pilot for Skylab-3 (July 28 
  to September 25, 1973) and was spacecraft commander on STS-3 (March 22-30, 1982), 
  logging a total of over 1,619 hours in space. Lousma also spent 11 hours on 
  two spacewalks outside the Skylab space station. He also served as backup docking 
  module pilot of the United States flight crew for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project 
  (ASTP) mission which was completed successfully in July 1975.</p>

<p>Jack Lousma left NASA in 1983.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> Skylab-3 (SL-3) (July 28 to 
  September 25, 1973). The crew on this 59-1/2 day flight included Alan L. Bean 
  (spacecraft commander), Jack Lousma (pilot), and Owen K. Garriott (science-pilot). 
  SL-3 accomplished 150% of mission goals while completing 858 revolutions of 
  the earth and traveling some 24,400,000 miles in earth orbit. The crew installed 
  six replacement rate gyros used for attitude control of the spacecraft and a 
  twin-pole sun-shade used for thermal control, and they repaired nine major experiment 
  or operational equipment items. They devoted 305 man hours to extensive solar 
  observations from above the earth's atmosphere, which included viewing two major 
  solar flares and numerous smaller flares and coronal transients. Also acquired 
  and returned to earth were 16,000 photographs and 18 miles of magnetic tape 
  documenting earth resources observations. The crew completed 333 medical experiment 
  performances and obtained valuable data on the effects of extended weightlessness 
  on humans. Skylab-3 ended with a Pacific Ocean splashdown and recovery by the 
  USS NEW ORLEANS.</p>

<p>STS-3, the third orbital test flight of space shuttle <i>Columbia</i>, launched 
  from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 22, 1982, into a 180-mile circular 
  orbit above the earth. Jack Lousma was the spacecraft commander and C. Gordon 
  Fullerton was the pilot on this 8-day mission. Major flight test objectives 
  included exposing the <i>Columbia</i> to extremes in thermal stress and the 
  first use of the 50-foot remote manipulator system (RMS) to grapple and maneuver 
  a payload in space. The crew also operated several scientific experiments in 
  the orbiter's cabin and on the OSS-1 pallet in the payload bay. Space Shuttle 
  <i>Columbia</i> responded favorably to the thermal tests and was found to be 
  better than expected as a scientific platform. The crew accomplished almost 
  100% of the objectives assigned to STS-3, and after a 1-day delay due to bad 
  weather, landed on the lakebed at White Sands, New Mexico, on March 30,1982, 
  having traveled 3.4 million miles during 129.9 orbits of the earth. Mission 
  duration was 192 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds.</p>
