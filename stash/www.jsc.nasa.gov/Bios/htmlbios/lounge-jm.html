<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:  </strong>Lounge entered  on active duty with the United States Navy following graduation from the U.S.  Naval Academy and spent the next nine years in a variety of assignments.  He completed Naval flight officer training at  Pensacola, Florida, went on to advanced training as a  radar intercept officer in the F-4J Phantom, and subsequently reported to  Fighter Squadron 142 based at Naval Air Station Miramar, California.  While with VF-142, he completed a 9-month Southeast Asia cruise aboard the USS ENTERPRISE  (participating in 99 combat missions) and a 7-month Mediterranean cruise aboard  the USS AMERICA.  In 1974, he returned to  the U.S. Naval Academy as an instructor in the Physics Department.  Lounge transferred to the Navy Space Project  Office in Washington, D.C., in 1976, for a 2-year tour as a staff  project office.  He resigned his regular  United States Navy commission in 1978.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>   Mr. Lounge has been employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space   Center since July  1978.  During this time, he worked as  lead engineer for Space Shuttle launched satellites, and also served as a  member of the Skylab Re-entry Flight Control Team.  He completed these assignments while with the  Payload Operations Division.</p>
<p>Selected as an  astronaut candidate by NASA in 1980, he completed a 1 year training and  evaluation period, and became an astronaut in August 1981.  He served as a member of the launch support  team at Kennedy Space Center  for the STS-1, STS-2, and STS-3 missions.   Following his first flight, he was assigned to the first mission to  carry the Centaur (cryogenically fueled) upper stage (STS-61F).  After the mission was canceled, he  participated in Space Station design development.  From 1989 through 1991, Mr. Lounge served as  Chief of the Space Station Support Office, representing astronaut interests in  Space Station design and operation planning.</p>
<p>A veteran of  three space flights, Mike Lounge logged more than 482 hours in space.  He was a mission specialist on STS-51I  (August 27 to September 3, 1985) and STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988)  and was the flight engineer on STS-35 (December 2 to December 10, 1990). </p>
<p>Mr. Lounge  resigned from NASA in June 1991.  He went  on to become Director of Space Shuttle and Space Station Program Development  for Boeing – NASA Systems.</p>

</p>
STS-26  Discovery, the first flight to be flown after the Challenger accident, launched  from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988.  During the 4-day mission, the crew  successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), which was  subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket.  They also operated eleven mid-deck  experiments.  Discovery completed 64  orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.  Mission  duration was 97 hours, 57 seconds.
<p>STS-35 Columbia,  launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on December 2, 1990.  Lounge served as flight engineer on this  9-day flight that was dedicated to astronomy.   Very exciting observations of the Universe were collected by the ASTRO-1  ultraviolet telescope and by the Broad Band X-Ray Telescope.  Columbia  completed 142 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December  10, 1990.  Mission  duration was 215 hours, 5 minutes, 8 seconds.</p>
