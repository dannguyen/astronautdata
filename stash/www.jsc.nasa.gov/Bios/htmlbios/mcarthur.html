<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> <strong>:</strong> McArthur graduated from West Point in June  1973 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.  Following a tour with the 82nd Airborne  Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he entered the U.S. Army Aviation  School in 1975.  He was the top graduate  of his flight class and was designated an Army aviator in June 1976.  He subsequently served as an aeroscout team  leader and brigade aviation section commander with the 2nd Infantry Division in  the Republic of Korea.  In 1978, he was  assigned to the 24th Combat Aviation Battalion in Savannah, Georgia, where he  served as a company commander, platoon leader and operations officer. After  completing studies at Georgia Tech, he was assigned to the Department of  Mechanics at West Point as an assistant professor.  In June 1987, he graduated from the U.S. Naval  Test Pilot School and was designated an experimental test pilot.  Other military schools completed include the  Army Parachutist course, the Jumpmaster course and the Command and General  Staff Officers&rsquo; course.<br />
  McArthur  retired from the U.S. Army in 2001.</p>
<p>A master  army aviator, he has logged more than 9,000 flight hours in 41 different  air/spacecrafts.</p>
<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> McArthur was assigned to NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center  in August 1987 as a space shuttle vehicle integration test engineer.  Duties involved serving as the engineering  liaison for launch and landing operations of the space shuttle.  He was actively involved in the integrated  test of the flight control system for each orbiter for its return to flight and  was a member of the Emergency Escape and Rescue Working Group.</p>
<p>Selected by NASA in January  1990, McArthur became an astronaut in July 1991. Since then, McArthur has held  various assignments within the Astronaut Office, including working issues  relating to the solid rocket booster, redesigned solid rocket motor and the  advanced solid rocket motor.  He served  as chief of the Astronaut Office Flight Support branch, supervising astronaut  support of the Mission Control Center, prelaunch space shuttle processing and  launch and landing operations.  McArthur  also served as director of operations overseeing training activities for  astronauts in Star City, Russia and, later, as chief of the Astronaut Office  Space Station branch.  McArthur served as  commander on the Expedition 8 and 10 backup crews.  A veteran of four spaceflights, McArthur has  logged 224 days, 22 hours, 28 minutes and 10 seconds in space, including 24  hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time in four spacewalks. Subsequent  assignments included manager of the space shuttle safety and mission assurance office  and as the space shuttle orbiter project manager.  McArthur currently serves as the director of safety  and mission assurance for the Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT  EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-58 Columbia (October 18, 1993  through November 1, 1993) was launched from NASA&rsquo;s  Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base,  California. During the mission, the crew performed neurovestibular,  cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic and musculoskeletal medical  experiments on themselves and 48 rats, expanding our knowledge of human and  animal physiology both on Earth and in spaceflight. In addition, the crew performed  16 engineering tests aboard the orbiter Columbia and 20 Extended Duration  Orbiter Medical Project experiments. Additionally, the crew made extensive  contacts with school children and amateur radio operators around the world  through the Shuttle Amateur Radio experiment. The STS-58 mission was  accomplished in 225 Earth orbits in 336 hours, 13 minutes and 1 second.</p>
<p>STS-74 Atlantis (November 12,  1995  through November 20, 1995) was  NASA&rsquo;s second space shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian  Space Station Mir.  STS-74 was launched  from and returned to land at   Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the  eight day flight, the crew successfully  attached a permanent docking module to Mir, conducted experiments on a number  of secondary payloads and transferred one-and-a-half tons of supplies between  Atlantis and Mir.  The STS-74 mission was  accomplished in 129 Earth orbits, traveling 3.4 million miles in 196 hours, 30  minutes and 44 seconds.</p>
<p>STS-92 Discovery (October 11,  2000 through October 24, 2000) was launched from Kennedy Space Center and  returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California.  During the 13 day flight, the seven member  crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the  International Space Station (ISS) using Discovery&rsquo;s robotic arm and performed  four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened  the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first  resident crew. McArthur&rsquo;s  spacewalk time  totaled 13 hours and 16 minutes.  The  STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 Earth orbits, traveling 5.3 million  miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds.</p>
<p>Expedition 12 (September 30,  2005  through April 8, 2006).  McArthur was the commander and ISS science officer  on the Expedition12 crew, which launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in  Kazakhstan on September 30, 2005 aboard a Soyuz TMA spacecraft and docked with  the space station on October 3, 2005.  During  a 6-month tour of duty aboard the station, the crew conducted two spacewalks  and relocated their Soyuz spacecraft twice; becoming the first ISS crew to dock  to every Russian docking port on the complex. They also became the first two-person  crew to conduct a spacewalk in both Russian and U.S. spacesuits.  The mission was accomplished in 189 days, 19  hours and 53 minutes and included 11 hours and 5 minutes of spacewalk time.</p>
