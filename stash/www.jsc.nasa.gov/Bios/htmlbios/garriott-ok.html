<p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Owen K. Garriott (Ph.D.)<br />
NASA Astronaut (former)</strong></p>

<p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong> Born November 22, 1930 in Enid, Oklahoma.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> Graduated from Enid High School in 1948; received 
  a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1953 and 
  a M.S. and Ph.D from Stanford University in Electrical Engineering in 1957 and 
  1960, respectively. Completed one year U.S. Air Force Pilot Training Program 
  (1966), receiving qualification as pilot in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong> American Astronautical Society (Fellow), 
  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Associate Fellow), Institute 
  of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, American Geophysical Union, American 
  Association for the Advancement of Science, Association of Space Explorers (Board 
  of Directors), Astronaut Scholarship Foundation (Vice President and Vice Chairman).</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> National Science Foundation Fellowship, 
  1960-61; Honorary Doctorate of Science, Phillips University (Enid, OK), 1973; 
  NASA Distinguished Service Medal, 1973; Collier Trophy for 1973; Federation 
  Aeronautique International, Komarov Diploma for 1973; Goddard Memorial Trophy 
  for 1975; NASA Space Flight Medal, 1983; and additional awards related to his 
  space flights, including the Oklahoma Hall of Fame (1980), Oklahoma Air and 
  Space Hall of Fame (1980), the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (1997), the Oklahoma 
  Military Hall of Fame (2000) and Enid Public Schools Hall of Fame (2001).</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Served as electronics officer on active duty 
  in the U.S. Navy from 1953 to 1956. From 1961 through 1965 he was an Assistant 
  Professor, then Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering 
  at Stanford University. He performed research and led graduate studies in ionospheric 
  physics after obtaining his doctorate and authored or co-authored more than 
  45 scientific papers, chapters and one book, principally in areas of the physical 
  sciences.</p>

<p>In 1965 he was one of the first six Scientist-Astronauts selected by NASA. His 
  first space flight aboard Skylab in 1973 set a new world record for duration 
  of approximately 60 days, more than double the previous record. Extensive experimental 
  studies of our sun, of earth resources and in various life sciences relating 
  to human adaptation to weightlessness were made.</p>

<p>His second space flight was aboard Spacelab-1 in 1983, a multidisciplinary and 
  international mission of 10 days. Over 70 separate experiments in six different 
  disciplines were conducted, primarily to demonstrate the suitability of Spacelab 
  for research in all these areas. He operated the world's first Amateur Radio 
  Station from space, W5LFL, which has since expanded into an important activity 
  on dozens of Shuttle flights, Space Station MIR and now the International Space 
  Station, with scores of astronauts and cosmonauts participating.</p>

<p>Between these missions, he received a NASA fellowship for one year's study at 
  Stanford (1975-76) and held the posts of Deputy, Acting and Director of Science 
  and Applications at Johnson Space Center, (1974-75, 76-78). In the latter post 
  he was responsible for all research in the physical sciences at the Johnson 
  Space Center. From 1984 to 1986, he held the position of Project Scientist in 
  the Space Station Project Office. In this position he worked closely with the 
  external scientific communities and advised the Project Manager concerning the 
  scientific suitability of the Space Station design.</p>

<p>After leaving NASA in June, 1986, he consulted for various aerospace companies 
  and served as a member of several NASA and National Research Council Committees.</p>

<p>From January 1988 until May 1993, he was Vice President of Space Programs at 
  Teledyne Brown Engineering. This Division, which grew to over 1,000 people, 
  provided payload integration for all Spacelab projects at the Marshall Space 
  Flight Center and had a substantial role in the development of the U.S. Laboratory 
  for the International Space Station.</p>

<p>He has devoted additional time to several charitable activities in his home 
  town, including the Enid (OK) Arts and Sciences Foundation of which he was a 
  co-Founder in 1992. More recently, he has accepted a position as Adjunct Professor 
  in the Laboratory for Structural Biology at the University of Alabama in Huntsville 
  (UAH) and has participated in research activities there involving new microbes 
  he has returned from extreme environments such as very alkaline lakes and deep 
  sea hydrothermal vents. Hyperthermophiles were returned from several dives in 
  Russian MIR submersibles to the Rainbow Vents at a depth of 2,300 meters near 
  the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean. Other research activities included three trips 
  to Antarctica from which 20 meteorites were returned for laboratory study.</p>
