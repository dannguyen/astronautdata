His other technical assignments to date have included: Manager of ascent, entry, and launch abort issues for the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM), providing the voice link from the Mission Control Center during launch and entry for several Space Shuttle missions; Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, from October 1995 to April 1996, with responsibility for the coordination and implementation of mission operations activities in the Moscow region for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. From May 1996 to September 1998, he served as Acting Assistant Director (Technical), Johnson Space Center. From October 1998 through November 2002, Precourt was Chief of the Astronaut Corps, responsible for the mission preparation activities of all space shuttle and future International Space Station crews and their support personnel. In his final assignment he was the Deputy Manager for the International Space Station, responsible for the day-to-day management of ISS operations, on orbit assembly and the interfaces with NASA contractors and the International Partners. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 932 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-55 (April 26 to May 6, 1993), was the pilot on STS-71 (June 27 to July 7, 1995), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-84 (May 15-24, 1997) and STS-91 (June 2-12, 1998), the final scheduled Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> docking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. Precourt left NASA in March 2005 and is now working for Thiokol in Utah.</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-55 <em>Columbia</em> launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 26, 1993. Nearly 90 experiments were conducted during this German-sponsored Spacelab D-2 mission to investigate life sciences, materials sciences, physics, robotics, astronomy and the Earth and its atmosphere. STS-55 also flew the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) making contact with students in 14 schools around the world. After 160 orbits of the earth in 240 flight hours, the 10-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1993.</p>

<p>STS-71 (June 27 to July 7, 1995) was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station <em>Mir</em>, and involved an exchange of crews (seven-member crew at launch, eight-member crew on return). The <em>Atlantis</em> Space Shuttle was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian <em>Mir</em> Space Station. It also carried a Spacehab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed various life sciences experiments and data collections. STS-71 <em>Atlantis</em> launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Mission duration was 235 hours, 23 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-84 <em>Atlantis</em> (May 15-24, 1997) carried a seven-member international crew. This was NASA&rsquo;s sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station <em>Mir</em>. During the 9-day flight, the crew conducted a number of secondary experiments and transferred nearly 4 tons of supplies and experiment equipment between the Space Shuttle and the <em>Mir</em> station. STS-84 <em>Atlantis</em> launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Mission duration was 221 hours and 20 minutes.</p>

<p>STS-91 <em>Discovery</em> (June 2-12, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-<em>Mir</em> docking mission and marked the conclusion of the highly successful joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. The crew, including a Russian cosmonaut, performed logistics and hardware resupply of the <em>Mir</em> during four docked days. They also conducted the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment, which involved the first of its kind research of antimatter in space. Mission duration was 235 hours, 54 minutes.</p>
