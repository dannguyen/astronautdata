    <p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>   Graduated from York High School, York,
      Maine;  completed Naval Academy Prep School, Newport, Rhode Island, 1989; 
      received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, U.S. Naval Academy, 1993; 
      received a Master of Science in Ocean Engineering, Massachusetts Institute
      of Technology, 2000.</p>
    <p><strong>ORGANIZATIONS:</strong>  U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association;
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alumni Association; Fraternal Order
      of Underwater Demoliton Team (UDT)/Sea, Air, Land Team (SEAL) Association.</p>
    <p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong>  Honor graduate of Basic Underwater
      Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Class 192;  awarded the Bronze Star with combat
      ‘V’ and Presidential Unit Citation for leading a nine-day operation at the
      Zharwar Kili cave complex – a national priority objective directly on the
      Afghanistan/Pakistan border; Quest speaker at the U.S. Naval Academy
      Combat Leadership Seminar, 2003, 2004;  awarded a second Bronze Star for
      combat leadership service in Afghanistan, 2004;  NASA Exceptional
      Achievement Medal.</p>
    <p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Ten years as a member of the U.S. Navy
      SEALs Team.  He made four six-month deployments: two to Afghanistan, and
      two to the Mediterranean.  Cassidy served as executive officer and
      operations officer of Special Boat Team Twenty in Norfolk, Virginia, and
      SEAL platoon commander at SEAL Team THREE in Coronado, California.  He
      deployed to the Afghanistan region two weeks after September 11, 2001,
      served as ground assault force commander for international and U.S. only
      combat missions in Afghanistan, and led two months of noncompliant
      ship-boardings in the Northern Arabian Gulf.  He was SEALs delivery
      vehicle platoon commander at SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team TWO in Norfolk,
      VA.  He accumulated more than 200 hours underwater as
      pilot/navigator/mission commander of a two-man flooded submersible SEAL
      Delivery Vehicle (SDV), which is launched and recovered from a host-ship
      submarine.  He also served as dry deck shelter platoon commander at SEAL
      Delivery Team TWO in Norfolk, VA. Cassidy volunteered for and completed a
      week-long, 180-mile charity kayak paddle from Norfolk, VA to Washington,
      D.C. to raise money and awareness for the Special Operations Warrior
      Foundation.   </p>
    <p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Cassidy as an astronaut was selected
      by NASA in May 2004.  In February 2006, he completed Astronaut Candidate
      Training that included scientific and technical briefings, intensive
      instruction in shuttle and International Space Station systems,
      physiological training, T-38 flight training, and water and wilderness
      survival training.  Completion of this initial training qualified him for
      various technical assignments within the Astronaut Office and future
      flight assignment as a mission specialist.  From 2006 through 2008, he
      served as Capsule Commander (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center. 
      During his NASA career, Cassidy completed six spacewalks, totaling 31
      hours, 14 minutes and accumulated 182 days in space.  He is currently in
      charge of the EVA branch within the Astronaut Office.</p>
    <p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS-127, International Space
      Station Assembly Mission 2J/A, Endeavour (July 15, 2009 through July 31,
      2009) delivered the Japanese-built Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) and the
      Experiment Logistics Module Exposed Section (ELM-ES) to the station.  The
      crew completed the construction of the KIBO Japanese Experiment Module,
      installed scientific experiments on its Exposed Facility and delivered
      critical spare parts and replacement batteries to the orbital complex, in
      addition to transferring 24,638 pounds of hardware and 1,225 pounds of
      water to the station.  </p>
    <p align="center">While the shuttle was docked to the station, the mission
      featured a record 13 astronauts working aboard the station representing
      all five space station partners: NASA, the Russian Space Agency, the
      Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency and the Japanese Space
      Agency.  Cassidy performed three spacewalks totaling 18 hours and 5
      minutes.  The mission was accomplished in 248 Earth orbits, traveling
      6,547,853 million miles in 15 days, 16 hours, 44 minutes and 58 seconds.</p>
    <p>Expedition 35/36 (March 28, 2013 through September 11, 2013).  Cassidy
      and Russian cosmonauts Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin launched
      from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space
      Station.  The three crew members were the first to complete an expedited
      trip to the station - instead of taking the standard two days to
      rendezvous and dock, they arrived at the orbiting complex in less than six
      hours.  Cassidy, Vinogradov and Misurkin were welcomed to the space
      station by  Chris Hadfield of the Canadian Space Agency, Tom Marshburn of
      NASA and Roman Romanenko of Roscosmos.  The crew members saw the arrival
      of the European ATV-4cargo spacecraft, the Japanese HTV-4 cargo spacecraft
      and two Russian Progress resupply spacecraft. The trio also worked on
      hundreds of research experiments and science investigations that will have
      benefits for future human spaceflight and life on Earth.  Cassidy
      conducted three spacewalks during his 166 days aboard the station.  During
      the expedition, the crew completed 2,656 Earth orbits and traveled more
      than 70 million miles.<br />
