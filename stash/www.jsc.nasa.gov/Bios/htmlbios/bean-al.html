<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Alan Bean, a Navy ROTC Student at Texas, 
  was commissioned upon graduation in 1955. After completing flight training, 
  he was assigned to a jet attack squadron in Jacksonville, Florida. After a four-year 
  tour of duty, he attended the Navy Test Pilot School, then flew as a test pilot 
  on several types of naval aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong> Alan Bean was one of the third group 
  of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. He served as backup astronaut for 
  the Gemini 10 and Apollo 9 missions.</p>

<p>Captain Bean was lunar module pilot on Apollo 12, mans second lunar landing. 
  In November 1969, Captain Bean and Captain Pete Conrad landed in the moons 
  Ocean of Stormsafter a flight of some 250,000 miles. They explored the lunar 
  surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments, and installed the first 
  nuclear power generator station on the moon to provide the power source. Captain 
  Richard Gordon remained in lunar orbit photographing landing sites for future 
  missions.</p>

<p>Captain Bean was spacecraft commander of Skylab Mission II (SL-3), July 29 to 
  September 25, 1973. With him on the 59-day, 24,400,000 mile world record setting 
  flight were scientist-astronaut Dr. Owen K. Garriott and Marine Corps Lieutenant 
  Colonel Jack R. Lousma. Mission II accomplished 150% of its pre-mission forecast 
  goals.</p>

<p>On his next assignment, Captain Bean was backup spacecraft commander of the 
  United States flight crew for the joint American-Russian Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.</p>

<p>Captain Bean has logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in spaceof which 10 hours 
  and 26 minutes were spent in EVAs on the moon and in earth orbit. Captain Bean 
  has flown 27 types of military aircraft as well as many civilian airplanes. 
  He has logged more than 7,145 hours flying timeincluding 4,890 hours in jet 
  aircraft. Captain Bean retired from the Navy in October 1975 but continued as 
  head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group within the Astronaut 
  Office in a civilian capacity.</p>

<p>Bean resigned from NASA in June 1981 to devote his full time to painting. He 
  said his decision was based on the fact that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, 
  he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artists eye, past 
  or present, has ever viewed firsthand and he hopes to express these experiences 
  through the medium of art. He is pursuing this dream at his home and studio in Houston.</p>
