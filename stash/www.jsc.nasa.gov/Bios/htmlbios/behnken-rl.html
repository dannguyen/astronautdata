    <p class="bioplainCAPS"><strong>Robert L. Behnken (COLONEL, USAF, Ph.D.)<br />
        NASA Astronaut</strong></p>
    <p><strong>PERSONAL DATA:</strong>  Hometown:  St. Ann, Missouri.  Married. 
      Recreational interests include mountain biking, skiing and backpacking. 
      He has a younger sister, four nephews and two nieces.  His father resides
      in St. Ann, Missouri.</p>
    <p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong>  Pattonville High School, Maryland Heights,
      Missouri, 1988<br />
      Bachelor of Science in Physics and Bachelor of Science in Mechanical
      Engineering, Washington University, 1992<br />
      Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, California Institute of
      Technology, 1993  <br />
      Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering, California Institute of Technology,
      1997</p>
    <p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong>  Outstanding Mechanical Engineering
      Senior, Washington University (1992); National Science Foundation Graduate
      Research Fellow (1993 to 1996); United States Air Force medals include
      Meritorious Service, Defense Meritorious Service and Defense Superior
      Service; NASA Space Flight Medals (2008, 2010)</p>
    <p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Colonel Behnken’s thesis research was in
      the area of nonlinear control applied to stabilizing rotating stall and
      surge in axial flow compressors.  The research included nonlinear
      analysis, real-time software implementation development and extensive
      hardware construction.  During his first two years of graduate study,
      Colonel Behnken developed control algorithms and hardware for flexible
      robotic manipulators.</p>
    <p>Prior to entering graduate school, Colonel Behnken was an Air Force
      Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) student at Washington University
      in St. Louis and, after graduate school, was assigned to Eglin Air Force
      Base, Florida.  While at Eglin, he worked as a Technical Manager and
      Developmental Engineer for munitions systems.  Colonel Behnken was next
      assigned to attend the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force
      Base, California.  After graduating, he was assigned to the F-22 Combined
      Test Force (CTF) at Edwards.  In the F-22 test program, he served as the
      lead Flight Test Engineer for the 4th F-22.  Colonel Behnken has more than
      1,300 flight hours in more than 25 different types of aircraft.<strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Selected as a Mission Specialist by
      NASA in July 2000, Colonel Behnken reported for training in August 2000. 
      Following the completion of 18 months of training and evaluation, he was
      assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Shuttle branch,
      supporting launch and landing activities at Kennedy Space Center,
      Florida.  During the fall of 2008, Colonel Behnken trained as a Mission
      Specialist for STS-400, the launch-on-need rescue flight for the last
      Hubble servicing mission.  Since then, within the Astronaut Office, he has
      served in the Exploration branch, as Chief of the Space Station Operations
      Branch, and as Deputy Chief for Space Station Operations.  Currently,
      Colonel Behnken serves as the Chief of the Astronaut Office.</p>
    <p><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  Colonel Behnken flew STS-123 in
      March 2008 and STS-130 in February 2010, logging more than 708 hours in
      space, including more than 37 hours in six spacewalks.  </p>
    <p>STS-123 Endeavour (March 11 to March 26, 2008) was a night launch/landing
      and the 25th International Space Station assembly mission.  Endeavour’s
      crew delivered the first component of the Japan Aerospace Exploration
      Agency (JAXA) Kibo Laboratory and the final element of the station’s
      Mobile Servicing System, the Canadian-built Special Purpose Dexterous
      Manipulator, known as Dextre.  Colonel Behnken served as Mission
      Specialist 1 for ascent and entry, performed three spacewalks, served as
      the Internal Spacewalk Coordinator (IV) and operated both the station
      robotic arm and the Dextre robot.  The mission was accomplished in 250
      orbits of the Earth, traveling 6,577,857 statute miles in 15 days, 18
      hours, 10 minutes and 54 seconds. </p>
    <p>STS-130 Endeavour (February 8 to February 21, 2010) was a night
      launch/landing and the 32nd International Space Station assembly mission. 
      Endeavour’s crew delivered and outfitted Node 3, also known as
      Tranquility, and the Cupola, a seven‑window observation portal for
      observing the Earth and space.  Colonel Behnken served as Mission
      Specialist 4, operated the space station robotic arm, served as the
      spacewalking lead and performed three spacewalks.  The mission was
      accomplished in 217 orbits of the Earth, traveling 5,738,991 statute miles
      in 13 days, 18 hours, 6 minutes and 24 seconds.</p>
