<p align="center"><strong>SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong>  STS 41-D launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August  30, 1984.  This was the maiden flight of space shuttle Discovery.  During this six-day mission, the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed three satellites (SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2 and TELSTAR 3C) and operated the CFES‑III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment and photography experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera.  The crew earned the name &ldquo;Icebusters&rdquo; for successfully removing hazardous ice particles from the orbiter using the Remote Manipulator System.  STS 41-D completed 96 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984.</p>
<p>STS-29 Discovery launched from Kennedy Space Center on March 13, 1989.  During this highly successful five-day mission, the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a space station &ldquo;heat pipe&rdquo; radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment.  In addition, the crew took more than 3,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70 mm movie camera.  Mission duration was 80 orbits of the Earth and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base on March 18, 1989.</p>
<p>STS-39, an unclassified eight-day Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center on April  28, 1991.  The seven-member crew worked around the clock in two-shift operations, during which they deployed, operated and retrieved the SPAS-II spacecraft, in addition to conducting various science experiments, including research of both natural and induced phenomena in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.  After completing 134 orbits of the Earth, Discovery and her crew landed at Kennedy Space Center on May 6, 1991.</p>
