  Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, 
  California. During the six day flight the crew deployed the SATCOM KU satellite, 
  and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing.</p>

<p>STS-26 <i>Discovery</i> (September 29 to October 3, 1988) was the first mission 
  flown after the <i>Challenger</i> accident. During the four day flight, the 
  crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), and
