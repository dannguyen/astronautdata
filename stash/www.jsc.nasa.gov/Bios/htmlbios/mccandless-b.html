  Association (Class of 1958), the U.S. Naval Institute, the Institute of Electrical 
  &amp; Electronic Engineers, the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics, 
  the Association for Computing Machinery, and the National Audubon Society; fellow 
  of the American Astronautical Society, and former president of the Houston Audubon 
  Society.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL HONORS:</strong> Legion of Merit (1988); Department of 
  Defense Distinguished Service Medal (1985); National Defense Service Medal; 
  American Expeditionary Service Medal; NASA Exceptional Service Medal (1974); 
  American Astronautical Society Victor A. Prather Award (1975 &amp; 1985); NASA 
  Space Flight Medal (1984); NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal (1985); 
  National Aeronautic Association Collier Trophy (1985); Smithsonian Institution 
  National Air and Space Museum Trophy (1985). Awarded one patent for the design 
  of a tool tethering system that is currently used during Shuttle &quot;spacewalks.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> McCandless was graduated second in a class 
  of 899 from Annapolis and subsequently received flight training from the Naval 
  Aviation Training Command at bases in Pensacola, Florida, and Kingsville, Texas. 
  He was designated a naval aviator in March of 1960 and proceeded to Key West, 
  Florida, for weapons system and carrier landing training in the F-6A Skyray. 
  He was assigned to Fighter Squadron 102 (VF-102) from December 1960 to February 
  1964, flying the Skyray and the F-4B Phantom II, and he saw duty aboard the 
  USS FORRESTAL (CVA-59) and the USS ENTERPRISE (CVA(N)-65), including the latter's 
  participation in the Cuban blockade. For three months in early 1964, he was 
  an instrument flight instructor in Attack Squadron 43 (VA-43) at the Naval Air 
  Station, Apollo Soucek Field, Oceana, Virginia, and then reported to the Naval 
  Reserve Officer's Training Corps Unit at Stanford University for graduate studies 
  in electrical engineering.</p>

<p>He has gained flying proficiency in the T-33B Shootingstar, T-38A Talon, F-4B 
  Phantom II, F-6A Skyray, F-11 Tiger, TF-9J Cougar, T-1 Seastar, and T-34B Mentor 
  airplane, and the Bell 47G helicopter. He has logged more than 5,200 hours flying 
  time -- 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>NASA EXPERIENCE</strong>: McCandless is one of the 19 astronauts 
  selected by NASA in April 1966. He was a member of the astronaut support crew 
  for the Apollo 14 mission and was backup pilot for the first manned Skylab mission 
  (SL-1/SL-2). He was a co-investigator on the M-509 astronaut maneuvering unit 
  experiment which was flown in the Skylab Program, and collaborated on the development 
  of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) used during Shuttle EVAs. He has been responsible 
  for crew inputs to the development of hardware and procedures for the Inertial 
  Upper Stage (IUS), Space Telescope, the Solar Maximum Repair Mission, and the 
  Space Station Program.</p>

<p>A veteran of two space flights, McCandless has logged over 312 hours in space, 
  including 4 hours of MMU flight time. He flew as a mission specialist on STS-41B 
  (February 3-11, 1984) and STS-31 (April 24-29, 1990). - more -</p>

<p><strong>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</strong> STS-41B <i>Challenger</i>, launched 
  from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 3, 1984. The crew on this 
  tenth Space Shuttle Mission included Mr. Vance Brand (spacecraft commander), 
  Commander Robert L. Gibson, USN, (pilot), and fellow mission specialists, Dr. 
  Ronald E. McNair, and Lt. Col. Robert L. Stewart, USA. The flight accomplished 
  the proper shuttle deployment of two Hughes 376-series communications satellites. 
  Rendezvous sensors and computer programs were flight tested for the first time. 
  This mission marked the first checkout of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), 
  and Manipulator Foot Restraint (MFR). McCandless made the first, untethered, 
  free flight on each of the two MMU's carried on board and alternated with Stewart 
  in the activities constituting two spectacular extravehicular activities (EVAS). 
  The German Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS), Remote Manipulator System (RMS), 
  six Getaway Specials, and materials processing experiments were included on 
  the mission. The 8 day orbital flight of <i>Challenger</i> (OV-099) culminated 
  in the first landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 
  1984. With the completion of this flight McCandless logged 191 hours in space 
  (including 4 hours of MMU flight time).</p>

<p>STS-31 <i>Discovery</i>, launched on April 24, 1990, from the Kennedy Space 
  Center in Florida. The crew aboard Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i> included Col. 
  Loren J. Shriver, USAF, (spacecraft commander), Col. Charles F. Bolden, USMC, 
  (pilot), and Dr's. Steven A Hawley, and Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan (mission specialists). 
  During this 5 day mission, the crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope, and 
  conducted a variety of middeck experiments involving the study of protein crystal 
  growth, polymer membrane processing, and the effects of weightlessness and magnetic 
  fields on an ion arc. They also operated a variety of cameras, including both 
  the IMAX in cabin and cargo bay cameras, for earth observations from their record 
  setting altitude of 380 miles. Following 76 orbits of the earth in 121 hours, 
  STS-31 <i>Discovery</i> landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 
  29, 1990.</p>
