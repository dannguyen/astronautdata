Man must rise above the Earth – to the top of the atmosphere and beyond – for only thus
will he fully understand the world in which he lives.

                                         PREFACE
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected the first group of
astronauts in 1959. From 500 candidates having the required jet aircraft flight
experience and engineering training as well as height below 5 feet 11 inches, 7 military
men became the Nation's first astronauts. The second and third groups chosen included
civilians who had extensive flying experience. By 1964, requirements had changed, and
emphasis was placed on academic qualifications; in 1965, 6 scientist astronauts were
selected from a group of 400 applicants who had a Doctorate or equivalent experience
in the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering. The group named in 1978 was the
first of space shuttle flight crews and since then, 14 additional groups have been
selected with a mix of pilots and mission specialists.

There are currently 50 active astronauts and 35 management astronauts in the
program; 196 astronauts have retired or resigned; and 49 are deceased.

Though most of the information in this document pertains only to U.S. Astronauts,
several sections are included to provide information about the international astronauts
and Cosmonauts who are currently partners with the U.S. Space Program participating
in the International Space Station endeavor.

The space flights and statistics listed in this publication resulted from the vertical takeoff
of an American space vehicle or Soyuz taxi flight to the International Space Station.
Astronauts listed (unless otherwise noted) are individuals who participated in the United
States astronaut program.

NASA accepts applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program on a continuing basis
and selects candidates as needed.

6.0      CONGRESSIONAL SPACE MEDAL OF HONOR
In honor of NASA's 20th anniversary, President Jimmy Carter visited NASA John F. Kennedy
Space Center on October 1, 1978, and awarded the first Congressional Space Medal of Honor
to six former astronauts. Authorized by Congress in 1969, the award recognized "any astronaut
who in the performance of his duties has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious
efforts and contributions to the welfare of the Nation and mankind." Recipients are
recommended by the NASA Administrator and presented by the President of the United States.
These astronauts received this special honor:

    Neil A. Armstrong, for actions to overcome problems on the Gemini 8 mission and for
Apollo 11 when he took his "...giant leap for mankind."

      Frank Borman, who commanded the Gemini 7 and Apollo 8 missions. The latter was the
first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon.

    Charles Conrad, Jr., who participated in four space flights of increasing duration, complexity
and achievement: Gemini 5, Gemini 11, Apollo 12, and Skylab 2. On the first manned Skylab
mission, he commanded the crew that performed repairs to the damaged orbital workshop, thus
saving the two billion dollar program from potential failure.

    John H. Glenn, Jr., who in Mercury 6 was the first American to orbit the Earth. The
success of his flight demonstrated the value of the human pilot in space.

    Virgil I. Grissom (posthumously), the second American in space, who took part in Mercury
and Gemini flights and lost his life during preparations for the first Apollo flight. He flew on
Mercury 4 and Gemini 3.

   Alan B. Shepard, Jr., who was the first American in space, aboard Mercury 3. He also
commanded the Apollo 14 mission.

Roger B. Chaffee (posthumously) was one of the third groups of astronauts chosen but lost his
life before his first flight during preparations for the first Apollo flight. President William Clinton
awarded the medal on December 17, 1997.

Edward H. White (posthumously) piloted Gemini 4 and performed the first U.S. space walk,
floating outside the capsule for 21 minutes. President William Clinton awarded the medal on
December 17, 1997.

John W. Young, who demonstrated leadership, courage, and technical skill in a space flight
career that spanned two decades and five (at that time) space flights pivotal to human progress
in space. He flew on Gemini 3, Gemini 10, Apollo 10, Apollo 16, and STS-1 prior to receipt of
the medal which was presented May 19, 1981, by President Ronald Reagan.

Thomas J. Stafford, who commanded the first flight of the lunar module to the Moon and the
American crew that rendezvoused with a Soviet spacecraft in 1975. He was recognized for his
past contributions, and for continuing to serve the Nation in charting a future vision for our space
program. He flew on Gemini 6 and 9, Apollo 10, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Vice
President Dan Quayle at the direction of President George Bush presented the medal in 1992.

James A. Lovell, who flew on Gemini 7 and 12, and Apollo 8 and 13, was presented the medal
on July 26, 1995. In his remarks, President Bill Clinton especially commended Lovell for his
performance on Apollo 13, which demonstrated, “the kind of resourcefulness, grit, and grace
under pressure that is the province of heroes.”

Shannon Lucid, who spent 188 days in space on the U.S. shuttle and Russian space station
Mir, was presented the medal on December 2, 1996. Noting that the medal is given out
sparingly because it honors “extraordinary service to the nation,” President Bill Clinton added
that “Dr. Lucid achieved that kind of service for 188 days this year, the longest flight by an
American in space, the longest time for any woman of any nation in space, five shuttle missions
altogether.”

William Shepherd, who was the first astronaut to command a crew on the International Space
Station, received the medal from President George W. Bush on January 15, 2003. Shepherd
and the two other members of his crew spent 141 days in space, beginning a new era of
international cooperation in space exploration.

Rick D. Husband, Willie C. McCool, David M. Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Michael P. Anderson,
Laurel B. Clark and Ilan Ramon were posthumously presented the medal for their ultimate
sacrifice in service to their Nations and mankind. President George W. Bush presented the
medal to their families on February 3, 2004.

Francis R. Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Judith A. Resnik, Ellison S. Onizuka, Ronald E.
McNair, Gregory B. Jarvis and Sharon Christa McAuliffe were posthumously presented
the medal for their ultimate sacrifice in service to their Nation and mankind. President George
W. Bush presented the medal to their families on July 23, 2004.
